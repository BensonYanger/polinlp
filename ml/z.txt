Parts of ObamaCare are starting to fray, even before full implementation.\nThe Obama administration now says a special system of exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses to provide insurance will be delayed an entire year -- to 2015.\n"Lots of small businesses struggle with providing insurance for their workers so this was supposed to facilitate it and make it easier for small business to do this," said Jim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. "It was a huge portion of the sale job. When they passed the law in 2010 there were many senators and members of Congress who were saying \'I am doing this because it\'s going to help small businesses.\'"\nThe exchanges were designed to give workers a range of choices supported by dollars from their employers. But now they will have only one choice until 2015, which could mean they can\'t shop for insurance that includes their current providers. Capretta said the administration is "way" behind schedule.\nSince insurance is more expensive for small businesses, many of which have no obligation under the law to provide coverage, analysts now fear many might just stop trying and let workers go on the soon-to-be-launched state exchanges.\nSara Teppema of the Society of Actuaries -- which did an exhaustive study of ObamaCare -- said that "even if it\'s just a small change of people who are leaving the employment-based insurance and coming into the individual insurance market, their costs and their numbers will overwhelm those who are currently uninsured."\nThat means costs would increase.\nMeanwhile, 79 senators including several liberal lawmakers recently voted to repeal a new tax on medical devices contained in the health care law following a similar vote in the House.\n"The House and the Senate agreeing? This is a harmonic convergence, it doesn\'t happen," said former Democratic Sen. Evan Bayh. "But on this it\'s happened because the adverse consequences to our economy and the quality of health care are so apparent."\nThe two separate votes have not become law but show widespread opposition to the 2.3 percent sales tax on medical devices. Critics say the law is unfair to the industry since it\'s a tax on gross sales -- meaning it adds up to a much bigger percentage of a company\'s profits.\nBut supporters such as Paul Van de Water of the Center for American Progress oppose any repeal.\n"I think that repealing the device tax would be irresponsible. We need the revenue and it\'s not going to be a job killer," he said.\nThe theory was that ObamaCare would insure 30 million more people and that device makers, like pharmaceutical companies, would get lots of new customers and a steady stream of new revenue to make up for the tax. Van de Water predicted that would still happen.\n"These device manufacturers are for the most part going to be getting a large increase in business thanks to health reform, thanks to ObamaCare," he said.\nBut the CEO of one company said that\'s not true for the 7,000 small companies with 400,000 employees who make a wide range of devices.\nChristine Jacobs of Theragenics said: "We make widgets -- hips, knees, stents, pacemakers, and implants, even, for prostate cancer. Those widgets tend to be used by people that are elderly. As the body parts wear out, we\'re needed."\nBut Jacobs notes that most people whose body parts wear out are already on Medicare, so ObamaCare does not provide a new revenue stream for her company -- only financial pain.\n"In the case of a small company, that medical device tax is equal to our R-and-D budget for this year," Jacobs said.\nBayh said in his own state of Indiana, one company planned to open up to five facilities over the next five years but had to scrap those plans because of the "uncertainty created by this tax."\nJacobs said the huge multinational device makers might be able to handle the burden but not the small companies.\n"It\'s just such a disproportionate burden for little guys," she said. "Because we\'re all being told that it\'s the little companies that create the jobs. And that\'s not message that we\'re getting."\nThe tax will even be applied to sutures used on pets that Theragenics developed for the veterinary market.\nShe sought FDA approval to demonstrate the quality of her products. But now she said "it\'s hard for me not to get frosted on this one" -- she explained that whoever wrote the regulations said "if you have FDA approval, you will be taxed."\nPresident Obama has vowed to veto any repeal of the tax, but Bayh notes that 79 votes in the Senate would be more than enough to override any veto.\nJim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC). He joined FNC in 1996 as a senior White House correspondent.

Palinkas warned, too, that any group of “step-by-step” House immigration bills may be used as a tool by congressional leaders to get to a conference committee, at which point they would be combined with the Senate bill and sent to the president for his signature, and illegal immigrants would start getting amnesty. That is exactly what , Gang of Eight members Sens. and , , and have said they want to do.

The Obama administration finalized rules on Friday that allow religious-affiliated organizations opposing the use of contraception to opt out of a federal mandate requiring that they provide their employees with insurance coverage for birth control.\nThe mandates give women at nonprofit, religious-based organizations, like certain hospitals and universities, the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies at no charge.\nThe rules, which were first proposed in February and then open for comment through April, have undergone only minor changes. Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, deputy director for policy and regulations at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a call with reporters that the rules were "very similar" to the administration\'s original proposal.\nOne of the few noticeable changes is the process by which insurance companies reimburse nonprofit religious organizations -- such as nonprofit religious hospitals and institutions of higher education -- that object to contraceptive coverage. This process, officials from HHS said, has provided more distance between the groups that disapprove of contraceptive use and the insurance companies that will be supplying contraceptives to their employees at no cost.\nThese slight changes, said one HHS representative, came after hearing from stakeholders during a public comment period this year. In total, more than 400,000 comments were sent to the department on the rule.\nObjecting organizations and insurers will have until January 1, 2014, to comply with the new rules. This date was extended from August 1, 2013.\n"The health care law guarantees millions of women access to recommended preventive services at no cost," Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a Friday news release. "Today\'s announcement reinforces our commitment to respect the concerns of houses of worship and other non-profit religious organizations that object to contraceptive coverage, while helping to ensure that women get the care they need, regardless of where they work."\nSince Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, administration officials have said the administration has attempted to work out how nonprofit organizations can decline to provide contraception coverage to their employees on religious grounds without facing a penalty.\nIn a news release about the finalized plans, administration officials say these final rules "strike the appropriate" balance.\nIn February, the health agency said that while it could not provide a final cost of the plan, offering free coverage would lower expenses over the long term, partly because of improvements in women\'s health and fewer childbirths.\nAs part of the new rules, groups that are insured -- such as with student health plans at religious colleges -- would be required to let their insurer know that certain participants would like contraception coverage.\nBecause the insurer would be covering the costs, the changes would allow religious organizations morally opposed to contraception to avoid paying for it.\nAlthough many religious groups applauded the compromise, not everyone heralded it as a success.\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said in February that it does not support the Obama administration\'s proposals because they fall short of addressing concerns about religious freedom.\n"Because the stakes are so high, we will not cease from our effort to assure that health care for all does not mean freedom for few," Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, president of the conference, said in a February statement. "We will continue to stand united with brother bishops, religious institutions, and individual citizens who seek redress in the courts for as long as this is necessary."\n"This latest rule shows the administration is tone-deaf to religious freedom," said Anna Higgins, director at the Family Research Council. "Family Research Council strongly opposes the latest regulation that continues to mandate that life-ending drugs and contraceptive services be covered, with no copay, by health plans of businesses and organizations that have serious moral and religious objections."\nMichael Hash, director of the Office of Health Reform for HHS, said the changes that were made took into account suggestions from religious organizations that objected to the rules.\n"I think there is a much brighter line, simpler line, and we think that responds to the good many comments that we got," he said.\nAn original mandate on providing contraception was part of the new federal health care law spearheaded by President Obama, the Affordable Care Act. It required that insurers provide, at no cost to those insured, all forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\nHouses of worship were exempt immediately, and the administration widened those exemptions last year to include other religiously affiliated organizations, like universities and hospitals.\nThat still left groups across a wide spectrum of faiths -- many of which teach that contraception is morally wrong -- covered by the mandate. They denounced it as an infringement on religious liberty. A group of 43 Catholic organizations challenged the rules in federal court in May.\nThe administration had long defended the mandate, saying that it did not violate religious liberties.\nInstead of using a multipart test that required an employer to show "religious values as its purpose" and to "employ persons who share its religious tenets," the proposal followed the Internal Revenue Code\'s definition that includes "churches, other houses of worship, and their affiliated organizations."\nAfter an uproar among religious institutions that didn\'t want to pay for contraceptives, the Obama administration offered several alternatives in March 2012. These plans are a continuation of those efforts.\nThe issue of Obama\'s health care act mandating contraception coverage became a hot-button political issue during last year\'s presidential race.\n"President Obama used his health care plan to declare war on religion, forcing religious institutions to go against their faith," the ad said. "Mitt Romney believes that is wrong."\nAlthough the ad did not specifically mention the contraception rule, a news release that accompanied the ad justified the "war on religion" claim using an editorial published in the San Antonio Express-News in February about the health care law\'s rule on providing contraception.

The US House of Representatives has passed the controversial Cyber Information Sharing and Protection Act.\nCispa is designed to help combat cyberthreats by making it easier for law enforcers to get at web data.\nThis is the second time Cispa has been passed by the House. Senators threw out the first draft, saying it did not do enough to protect privacy.\nCispa could fail again in the Senate after threats from President Obama to veto it over privacy concerns.\nA substantial majority of politicians in the House backed the bill.\nThe law is passing through the US legislative system as American federal agencies warn that malicious hackers, motivated by money or acting on behalf of foreign governments, such as China, are one of the biggest threats facing the nation.\n"If you want to take a shot across China\'s bow, this is the answer," said Mike Rogers, the Republican politician who co-wrote Cispa and chairs the House Intelligence Committee.\n\'Fatally flawed\'\nCispa has also secured the backing of several technology firms, including the CTIA wireless industry group, as well as the TechNet computer industry lobby group, which has Google, Apple and Yahoo as members. By contrast, the social news website Reddit has been vocal in its opposition to the bill. In March, Facebook said it no longer supported Cispa.\nThe bill could fail again in the Senate after the Obama administration\'s threat to use its veto unless changes were made. The White House wants amendments so more is done to ensure the minimum amount of data is handed over in investigations.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has also opposed Cispa, saying the bill was "fatally flawed". The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Reporters Without Borders and the American Library Association have all voiced similar worries.\nCispa\'s authors say existing amendments have addressed many of the criticisms and more oversight was being given to data before it was handed over.

Microsoft worked with the National Security Agency and the FBI to provide the agencies with the encryption workarounds they needed for access to Skype video calls, Outlook Web chats and email, and information stored on Microsoft\'s cloud-based SkyDrive, according to new information shared by NSA leaker Edward Snowden with the Guardian newspaper.\nIn the latest round of disclosures about data-gathering practices of law enforcement in a program known as "Prism," Microsoft "has collaborated closely with U.S. intelligence services to allow users\' communications to be intercepted, including helping the National Security Agency to circumvent the company\'s own encryption, according to top-secret documents obtained by the Guardian," the newspaper reported Thursday.\nThe new files "provided by Edward Snowden illustrate the scale of cooperation between Silicon Valley and the intelligence agencies over the last three years," the Guardian said.\nMicrosoft, in a statement to NBC News, did not address the encryption workaround specifically, but said, "We only ever comply with orders about specific accounts or identifiers, and we would not respond to the kind of blanket orders discussed in the press over the past few weeks, as the volumes documented in our most recent disclosure clearly illustrate.\n"To be clear, Microsoft does not provide any government with blanket or direct access to SkyDrive, Outlook.com, Skype or any Microsoft product."\nThe company said when it upgrades or updates products, "legal obligations may in some circumstances require that we maintain the ability to provide information in response to a law enforcement or national security request. There are aspects of this debate that we wish we were able to discuss more freely. That\'s why we\'ve argued for additional transparency that would help everyone understand and debate these important issues."\nACLU principal technologist Chris Soghoian told NBC News that the new revelations show that "time and time again, companies that specifically advertise their services as privacy protecting have been forced to circumvent those privacy protections to enable the government to spy on their customers."\nMicrosoft isn\'t the only technology company believed to be cooperating with the government to share data, but it is the first to have more details revealed since the initial disclosures last month by Snowden.\nAt that time, he said that Microsoft and other technology companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Yahoo and AOL were allowing the FBI and NSA to look at Americans\' video, audio, photos, emails and other data files under what is known as the Prism program. Most of the companies, including Microsoft, have since requested government permission to share the information requests that have been made to them.\nAccording to the information shared by Snowden with the Guardian, Microsoft "helped the NSA to circumvent its encryption to address concerns that the agency would be able to intercept Web chats on the new Outlook.com portal."\nMicrosoft completed the transfer of its 300 million Hotmail users to Outlook.com, a more modern webmail experience, in May. The NSA "already had pre-encryption stage access to email on Outlook.com, including Hotmail," the Guardian said.\nThe Redmond, Wash.-based company "also worked with the FBI\'s Data Intercept Unit to \'understand\' potential issues with a feature in Outlook.com that allows users to create email aliases," the newspaper said.\nVideo-chat service Skype "worked with intelligence agencies last year to allow Prism to collect video of conversations as well as audio," the Guardian said.\nThere have been concerns since Microsoft bought Skype in 2011 about what data the Redmond company is sharing with law enforcement. Last January, dozens of organizations, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Digital Rights Foundation, sent an open letter to Microsoft asking how, when and why the popular video chatting program complies with government requests for information.\nIn March, Microsoft published a transparency report about Skype, and other of its services.\n"Microsoft and Skype received a total of 75,378 law enforcement requests," the company said in the report. "Those requests potentially impacted 137,424 accounts. While it is not possible to directly compare the number of requests to the number of users affected, it is likely that less than 0.02 percent of active users were affected."\nThe Guardian reports that Microsoft also worked with the FBI this year "to allow the NSA easier access via Prism to its cloud storage service SkyDrive, which now has more than 250 million users worldwide."\nIn its statement Thursday, Microsoft said it has "clear principles which guide the response across our entire company to government demands for customer information for both law enforcement and national security issues."\nThe company takes its "commitments to our customers and to compliance with applicable law very seriously, so we provide customer data only in response to legal processes." Microsoft\'s compliance team "examines all demands very closely, and we reject them if we believe they aren\'t valid."\nSnowden, 30, has worked with the Guardian since last month to share information he learned in his time as an NSA contractor about data-gathering practices of the NSA, one of the country\'s most secretive agencies.\nHe is now believed to be staying in the transit zone of Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, as he decides where he can go for asylum and where he can avoid being extradited to the United States. Federal prosecutors have charged Snowden with three counts of espionage.

Justice\'s delay isn\'t necessarily justice denied for Jill Kelley, the Tampa socialite entangled in the scandal that toppled former CIA director David Petraeus.\nThe Justice Department has asked for a 30-day extension, until Sept. 4, to respond to her lawsuit against the government for violating her family\'s privacy, rifling through her e-mails and leaking confidential information about her.\nAnd Kelley is fine with the extension, says her lawyer, Alan Raul. The government says it needs the time to sort through the allegations in the 65-page complaint. It doesn\'t help, Justice Department lawyers say, that Pentagon employees have been furloughed because of sequestration.\n"We are pleased that the federal government appears to be taking this case seriously, and is taking extra time to conduct its internal inquiry in response to this lawsuit," Raul said in a statement.\nKelley had been an unpaid social liaison to the military and had hosted parties for military officials, including Petraeus and Gen. John Allen, at her home on Tampa\'s Bayshore Boulevard. The headquarters of Central Command, which oversees military action in the Middle East, is a few miles away.\nPetraeus\' extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, was exposed after Kelley complained to the FBI about harassing e-mails she had received. Broadwell was behind them.\nAllen\'s name also popped up in Kelley\'s e-mails.\nThat prompted then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to call for an investigation of Allen\'s relationship with Kelley to determine if there had been "professional misconduct" on his part. Allen and Kelley say there was nothing inappropriate about their relationship. The Pentagon inspector general agreed, although the Defense Department refuses to release its findings. USA TODAY and other news organizations have filed multiple requests for the report but have been denied.\nAllen and Kelley exchanged 3,000 e-mails from July 2010 to July 2012, according to Rep. Jackie Speier, the California Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. She was briefed by the inspector general on the report but not shown the document. Of those e-mails, 41 were reviewed more thoroughly, Speier was told.\nSpeier wants Allen to divulge e-mails from his private account to Kelley. He refused to provide them to the inspector general, Speier said.\nKelley and her husband, Scott, want an apology and unspecified damages for what they say were willful leaks by federal officials of false and damaging information about them. Those officials should have been protecting them and their privacy, they say in their lawsuit.\n"The Kelleys are trying to deter the government from violating the privacy rights of other Americans by calling attention to the government\'s profound over-collection of private e-mails and egregious leaking of confidential investigative material," Raul said.

The following irresponsible police action reported by KHOU’s Rucks Russell should scare many. Here is the story as reported.\nA young 13 year old dancer, Landry Thompson, came to Houston from Oklahoma. She travelled with her two dance instructors over the weekend. The intent of their visit was to train all weekend with some of the best in dance industry.\nWhen they left the studio Saturday night they stopped at a gas station very exhausted as they searched for their lodging. They were trying to locate their hotel on the GPS. Out of nowhere they were surrounded by the Houston police.\nThe Houston police dragged them out of the car and handcuffed them all.\n“I was kind of freaked out and surprised by it,” said Landry Thompson.\n“They just pulled us out of the car. Put our hands behind out backs like we were criminals,” said Landry’s dance instructor Emmanuel Hurd. “He asked me; who is the girl? She is my student. I said I have a notarized letter from her parents stating that I have full guardianship over her while we are here.”\nLandry Thompson and the instructors said they pleaded with the police and told the police their story repeatedly. It did not matter to the Houston police. Landry Thompson said, “They still put handcuffs on me. And it really scared me. And they put me in the back of the cop car. I was terrified.” Landry Thompson was taken to Protective Services.\n“I was horrified. She was with the people I wanted her to be with. She was with people who were safe who I knew would take care of her,” said Her mother, Destiny Thompson. “Yet they had taken her away from those people and now she was in a shelter, wherever she was with people I didn’t know.”\nProtective Services told Destiny Thompson that she would have to fly to Houston to get her daughter. After many phone calls with various officials, Landry Thompson was released back into the custody of her dance instructors.\n“I would love an apology,” said Landry Thompson’s mother. “They owe her an apology.”\nSoon after, the trio was back at the dance studio. They intend to leave Houston on Monday afternoon.\nThe Houston police (HPD) has not been responding to inquiries as to what happened.\nWere Landry Thompson and dance instructors victims of stereotyping and racism?\nWhy did the Houston police believe they had to react as they did? Does it have anything to do with the young dancer being a young white girl and the two dance instructors being young black males? If the two instructors were white males would the police officers have reacted in the same manner? The dance instructors had notarized document detailing that they were the young girl’s guardian. What else were they expected to do to ensure they would not be treated like common criminals but the productive human beings they are?

Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) pushed back Tuesday against calls to put out more information on the committee’s investigation into the controversy, sparked after a Treasury Department Inspector General report revealed the IRS had singled out tea party groups applying for nonprofit status for extra scrutiny. Responding specifically to criticism from Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democratic member of the committee, Issa said that releasing full interviews conducted with IRS employees would hurt the ongoing investigation.\nSign up for membership to become a founding member and help shape HuffPost’s next chapter\n“Your decision to publicly announce that the investigation should wrap up was irresponsible, but not surprising,” said Issa, in a letter to Cummings. “However, your push to release entire transcripts from witness interviews while the investigation remains active was reckless and threatened to undermine the integrity of the Committee’s investigation.”\nThe position is a tenuous one for Issa, who during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union” just over a week ago promised that the full transcripts would be released. On that same program, Issa revealed several partial transcripts that suggested the directive to screen tea party groups came from officials in Washington.\nSince then, The Huffington Post has sent four emails asking Issa’s office when the full transcripts would be made public. Not one was returned. When asked why Issa’s release of a partial transcript was fine but he opposed releasing the transcripts in full, a spokesman for the congressman referred HuffPost to another statement.\n“Limited releases of testimony may also serve to empower other witnesses to become whistleblowers and serve to vindicate individuals who have been subjected to criticism or retaliation at the hands of their managers,” said Issa, in that statement. “On the other hand, if a full transcript were released, it would serve as a roadmap of the Committee’s investigation.”\nIt could take weeks, if not months, to see the full transcripts should the committee wait to release them until the investigation is completed. According to a Democratic aide on the committee, investigators have interviewed five IRS employees so far and have 18 more to go. In addition, investigators are hoping to look through hundred of thousands of documents that could shed light on the tax agency’s controversial screening practices.\nUnwilling to allow the partial transcripts Issa released to be the only evidence in the public record, Cummings this week also released segments of interviews. In a Sunday memo to his colleagues on the oversight committee, the congressman said that a manager in the IRS Cincinnati office who oversaw the nonprofit screening said that no one in Washington ordered him to employ the practice of targeting tea party groups.\n“Although the Committee interviewed a self-identified ‘conservative Republican’ who denied any White House involvement or any political motivation for screening Tea Party cases, Chairman Issa now appears to be going back on his promise to release the full interview transcripts of IRS employees,” said Cummings, in a statement. “Chairman Issa changes his mind so fast that even when I agree with him, we’re not on the same page.

Perez is not a favorite of congressional Republicans, and the charges could impact his pending confirmation hearing -- scheduled for this Thursday.\nThe report, obtained in advance by Fox News, claimed Perez in February 2012 "manipulated" federal law as assistant attorney general and "pushed the limits of justice to make this deal happen."\nBoth cases involved the city of St. Paul. The 67-page report states that the Justice Department\'s decision to opt out of the whistleblower cases potentially cost taxpayers as much as $200 million -- the amount the government could have won had it pursued damages in the case.\nBut, according to the report, the Justice Department stayed away from that case in order to get the city to drop an appeal to the Supreme Court on another matter. The department was allegedly concerned that the high court, in the course of reviewing that case, would strike down a major element of civil rights enforcement.\n"Perez simply could not allow the Court to rule," the report said. "Perez sought leverage to stop the city from pressing its appeal."\nThe case the Justice Department was allegedly concerned about was St. Paul\'s appeal to the Supreme Court, on a case in which property owners said the city made extraordinary efforts, through strict code enforcement, to condemn their properties.\nThe owners said reducing the amount of affordable housing for minorities violated the federal Fair Housing Act -- by what is known as "disparate impact."\nPerez appeared to think the Supreme Court overturning the case would have been a severe blow to civil rights enforcement, the report concluded.\nThe "disparate impact" provision, which the report described as legally questionable, prohibits housing policies that end up discriminating against certain groups even if those policies are not blatantly discriminatory.\n"Perez sought, facilitated, and consummated this deal because he feared that the Court would find disparate impact unsupported by the text of the Fair Housing Act," the report said.\nThe other end of the alleged deal was for the Justice Department not to get involved in cases against the city of St. Paul that alleged the city received millions in Department of Housing and Urban Development funds -- including stimulus money -- but failed to file the requisite paperwork regarding the hiring of low-income workers.\nIn that case, which also involved the city of Minneapolis, plaintiff Thomas Newell got neither the backing of the agency nor the Justice Department and lost the case, which if won would likely have resulted in the cities repaying tens of millions in damages.\nThe Obama administration has acknowledged that senior Justice Department attorneys recommended intervening in the case and characterized the False Claims Act infractions reported by Newell as "particularly egregious."\nHowever, they thought the case would be "quite weak and never should have been a serious candidate for intervention," according to the report.\nThe Justice Department claims everything was above board -- and that the department held three staff briefings, heard 24 hours of additional testimony and reviewed 1,400 pages of documents before deciding not to intervene.\n"The litigation decisions made by the department were in the best interests of the United States and were consistent with the department\'s legal, ethical, and professional responsibility obligations," the department said in a statement.\nFormer Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler also questioned the use of the term "quid pro quo" to describe what happened.\n"It\'s such a loaded term," she said. "I think in fact you have almost everybody agreeing nothing inappropriate happened."\nThe report -- subtitled "How Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez manipulated Justice and Ignored Rule of Law" -- was a joint effort by minority leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Republican-led House\'s Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees.\n"The facts surrounding this quid pro quo show that Perez may have exceeded the scope of the ethics and professional-responsibility opinions he received from the department and thereby violated his duties of loyalty and confidentiality to the United States. Perez also misled senior Justice Department officials about the quid pro quo," the report states.\nBut congressional Democrats put out a statement and memo of their own late Sunday refuting the details.\nThe statement said the "overwhelming evidence" indicates Perez and others "acted professionally to advance the interests of civil rights and effectively combat the scourge of discrimination in housing." They said the decision not to intervene in the suit against St. Paul was based on expert recommendations.\n"Instead of identifying inappropriate conduct by Mr. Perez, it appears that the accusations against him are part of a broader political campaign to undermine the legal safeguards against discrimination that Mr. Perez was protecting," they said.

Vice President Joe Biden has apologized to President Barack Obama for putting him in a tough position that led to Obama\'s announcement that he now supports same-sex marriage, senior administration officials said Thursday.\nObama said in an interview that aired Thursday on ABC that he made his decision public earlier than he had planned after Biden\'s weekend remark that he was "absolutely comfortable" with letting gays and lesbians marry.\nTwo senior administration officials said Biden and Obama met Wednesday morning, and Biden apologized for putting Obama in a tough spot. Obama responded by saying that he knew Biden was speaking from the heart, said the officials, who didn\'t want to be named discussing private conversations between the president and vice president.\nBiden\'s remarks on NBC\'s "Meet the Press" on Sunday launched a controversy that led to Obama announcing that his position on same-sex marriage, which he had previously called "evolving," had shifted to support. When Obama\'s full interview aired Thursday, he said his disclosure came sooner than planned as a result of Biden\'s comments.\n"I had already made a decision that we were going to probably take this position before the election and before the convention," Obama said on ABC\'s "Good Morning America." Biden "probably got out a little bit over his skis, but out of generosity of spirit," he said.\nSeparately, Biden spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said Obama "has been the leader on this issue from day one, and the vice president never intended to distract from that."\nOnce Biden\'s comments drew attention to the issue, Obama made plans to announce his support next week on a previously scheduled appearance on the ABC talk show "The View," a senior administration official said Thursday. The president and his advisers knew Obama would be asked about the issue in the wake of Biden\'s NBC interview, said the official, who didn\'t want to speak publicly about internal administration discussions.\nUltimately, they decided to move up the timeline and have him announce his support during the ABC interview at the White House, the official said. And a top Democrat told CNN that Obama knew the issue would come up at the convention, partly because of a push for support for same-sex marriage to be included in the Democratic Party platform, and in debates.\nMultiple top Democrats told CNN the president\'s senior aides are annoyed with Biden for forcing the conversation on same-sex marriage now. One source said Biden has, in the past, counseled the president against coming out for same-sex marriage, making this move that much more frustrating.\nBut the sources said they don\'t believe it will create a lasting rift between the two leaders. Biden is known to go off-script, something Obama knew when he selected his vice president.\nIn explaining to ABC how his position has evolved, Obama noted that his daughters Malia and Sasha have "friends whose parents are same-sex couples. It wouldn\'t dawn on them that somehow their friends\' parents would be treated differently. And frankly that\'s the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective, not wanting to somehow explain to your child why somebody should be treated differently when it comes to the eyes of the law."\nAsked about whether his new position is a calculated move in an election year, Obama said it would "be hard to argue that somehow this is something that I\'d be doing for political advantage. Because frankly, you know, the politics -- it\'s not clear how they cut."\nThe interview aired the same day Obama attended a fundraiser in Los Angeles, where support for same-sex marriage is strong. Movie star George Clooney hosted the event, which is raking in $15 million, according to a top Democratic source. And on Monday, openly gay singer Ricky Martin is hosting a fundraising event for Obama in New York.\nBut some in the African-American community have expressed strong disapproval of Obama\'s endorsement of same-sex marriage. A Democratic official said the White House has been actively reaching out to African-American community leaders and pastors and will continue to do so in the wake of the president\'s decision, but the official noted that even the president\'s base won\'t always agree with him on everything. "There are going to be issues you don\'t agree on," the official said.\nAnd Obama told ABC he won\'t spend much time talking about the issue, because he\'s focused on the economy. The announcement puts Obama squarely at odds with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has since reiterated his opposition to same-sex marriage.\n"And I do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name," Romney said during a Wednesday visit to Fort Lupton, Colorado. "My view is the domestic partnership benefits, hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate, but that the others are not."\nThe issue is a divisive one in American politics, but it\'s uncertain how the development might play out at the voting booth.\nA Gallup Poll released Tuesday indicated 50% of Americans believe same-sex marriages should be recognized by law as valid, with 48% saying such marriages should not be legal -- a dramatic shift from a few years ago. A Gallup poll in 2009 found 40% supported same-sex marriage and 57% were opposed.\nBut a CNN/ORC International poll, taken in late March, indicated policies toward gays and lesbians were tied for last in people\'s opinions of the most-important issues facing the country.\nObama said he supports states deciding the issue on their own, but added that he was "disappointed" by Tuesday\'s vote on the issue in North Carolina, where a ban on same-sex marriage was added to the constitution. Obama called the amendment discriminatory against gays and lesbians, a spokesman said earlier Wednesday.\nSix states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York -- and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union.\nIn February, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June, but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue. Maryland Gov. Martin O\'Malley signed into law a bill that permits the state\'s same-sex couples to wed as of January 1, and state residents may vote to affirm such a law.\nMinnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in North Carolina, while Maine will have a referendum on allowing same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice, one from California and another from Massachusetts, could be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court in coming months.

US Secretary of State John Kerry has said that in some cases, US spying has gone too far.\nMr Kerry is the most senior Obama administration official to have commented directly on an issue that has upset America\'s European allies.\nHe said he will work with the president to prevent further inappropriate acts by the National Security Agency.\nHis comments come as Asian countries have protested at claims that Australia was involved in a US-led spy network.\nChina has demanded an explanation of the reports, while Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador to Jakarta.\nIn other developments:\nMajor technology companies including Google, Apple and Yahoo have called for the US government to do more to rein in the NSA\'s activities.\nA German MP said ex-US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden is willing to travel to Berlin to help investigations into the alleged surveillance of Angela Merkel\'s phone.\nIndonesia\'s foreign minister said reports that the NSA used Australian embassies to eavesdrop on Asian countries would indicate a "serious breach" of diplomatic rules.\nIn his comments, Mr Kerry also defended the need for increased surveillance, saying it had thwarted terrorist attacks.\n"We have actually prevented airplanes from going down, buildings from being blown up, and people from being assassinated because we\'ve been able to learn ahead of time of the plans," Mr Kerry told a conference in London via video link.\n"I assure you, innocent people are not being abused in this process, but there\'s an effort to try to gather information. And yes, in some cases, it has reached too far inappropriately.\n"And the president, our president, is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people, and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse... we are going to make sure that does not happen in the future." he said.\nMr Kerry, in his remarks to a conference organised by the Open Government Partnership, said that while some surveillance may have been excessive, claims that up to 70 million were being monitored were an "exaggeration".\nClaims about the extent of US surveillance of targets such as European leaders have strained Washington\'s diplomatic relations with some of its key allies.\n\'Serious breach\'\nLast week it was alleged that German Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s mobile phone had been tapped for up to 10 years.\nMore recently there have been claims that the NSA hacked links connecting data centres operated by Google and Yahoo.\nAccording to the Sydney Morning Herald, Australia embassies in Asia had been used to spy on Asian countries such as China, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.\n"If confirmed, such action is not only a breach of security, but also a serious breach of diplomatic norms and ethics," Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said.\nThe report describes a signals intelligence programme called Stateroom which involves the interception of radio, telecommunications and internet traffic using equipment in US, British, Australian and Canadian diplomatic missions.\nAustralia\'s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade declined to comment on the latest reports.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott said: "Every Australian governmental agency, every Australian official... operates in accordance with the law."\nThe claims are the latest to emerge from documents leaked by ex-US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia and is wanted in the US in connection with the unauthorised disclosures.\nTechnology firms appeal\nIn Germany, a member of parliament has said Mr Snowden is willing to travel to Berlin to help investigate allegations about the tapping of Mrs Merkel\'s phone.\nHans-Christian Stroebele, who represents the opposition Green party, said there would need to be safeguards against Mr Snowden, who he recently visited in Moscow, being deported to the United States.\nThe BBC\'s Steve Evans, in Berlin, said Germany\'s Christian-Democrat-led government may be unwilling to invite Mr Snowden to the country, particularly as his presence would raise issues over extradition agreements with the United States.\nIn the wake of the claims about surveillance of online data centres, six major technology companies have called for the US government to do more to control the NSA\'s activities.\nThe six called for "appropriate oversight and accountability" in a letter sent to a US Senate committee sponsoring a bill designed to rein in the NSA.\nAOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo signed the letter to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, saying the greater control would help to rebuild trust in government surveillance programs.

You are their only reliable friend who watches helplessly as that little nation continues to isolate itself through its self-destructive policies. According to Goldberg, Obama has “become inured to what he sees as self-defeating policies of his Israeli counterpart…Obama said privately and repeatedly, “ doesn’t know what its own best interests are… Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.”

(Reuters) - Edward Snowden dropped out of high school, tried Army Reserve training but quit after four months, and then became a security guard.\nU.S. National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, an analyst with a U.S. defence contractor, is seen in this still image taken from a video during an interview with the Guardian in his hotel room in Hong Kong June 6, 2013. REUTERS/Courtesy of The Guardian/Glenn Greenwald/Laura Poitras/Handout\nNow at age 29, Snowden has become known worldwide as the man responsible for exposing vast surveillance programs by the National Security Agency, one of the most secretive government agencies in the United States.\nSnowden stepped from the shadows and admitted that he had exposed the U.S. government’s top-secret surveillance programs to Britain’s Guardian newspaper and the Washington Post after working in Hawaii for a company under contract to the NSA.\nAmericans are debating whether he is a patriotic defender of civil liberties or the most unprincipled of traitors.\nSnowden saw his role more clearly, saying the U.S. government’s powers of surveillance have grown so immense and intrusive that he felt compelled to denounce them, even at great personal cost. He could have remained anonymous but said his message would resonate more powerfully if he revealed his identity.\n“The public needs to decide whether these programs and policies are right or wrong,” Snowden told the Guardian in the 12-minute video introducing him to the world on Sunday.\nAbandoning his life in Hawaii last month, Snowden went into hiding in Hong Kong, saying he feared he could be captured by the CIA, another foreign government or Asian organized crime gangs.\n“That’s a fear I’ll live under for the rest of my life, however long that happens to be,” he said in the video.\nIn his secretive dealings with the Washington Post, he took the codename Verax - Latin to describe a truth teller - the paper said.\n“He’s very intelligent, calm, (but) always scared that someone would knock on the door and he’d be taken away,” said Ewen MacAskill, one of the Guardian journalists who worked on the story.\nSnowden expressed some interest in seeking asylum in Iceland. He checked out of his hotel in Hong Kong on Monday and his whereabouts were not known.\nIn recent years, he had returned to the Washington suburbs of his youth, before taking his final assignment in Hawaii.\n“He was quiet, shy, always walked around with his head down,” said Joyce Kinsey, a neighbor in Ellicott City, Maryland, who said Snowden moved into an apartment there about three years ago and that his mother soon followed. He later moved to Hawaii.\n“They are a nice family. I feel really, really sorry for his mother. She always left her curtains open and you could see right in. But now since all these reporters showed up, she’s keeping the curtains closed. This whole neighborhood is shocked.”\nQUIET SUBURBAN CHILDHOOD\nLittle from Snowden’s childhood could portend his future place alongside Daniel Ellsberg, who disclosed the so-called Pentagon Papers during the Vietnam War, and Bradley Manning, the U.S. Army private on military trial for providing WikiLeaks with documents, as one of the most important leakers of U.S. secrets.\nAs a youth in the Washington suburb of Fort Meade, Maryland, Snowden attended local schools, but dropped out of Arundel High School about halfway through his sophomore year, said school spokesman Bob Mosier.\nSnowden’s parents divorced when he was 18 and they lived in Crofton, Maryland, a planned community where many NSA employees and their families live.\nSnowden told the Guardian he joined the military with the idea of aiding the U.S. war effort in Iraq and to “help free people from oppression.” He lasted only four months after breaking both legs in a training exercise, he said. Pentagon records show he enlisted in the Army Reserve as a special forces recruit, entering in May 2004 and leaving four months later without completing his training.\nLater he landed his first job at the University of Maryland working at a covert NSA facility near the campus, Snowden said. He then went to the CIA in information technology security, rising quickly because of his understanding of the Internet and his computer programming skills, he told the Guardian.\nBy 2007, the CIA had stationed him with diplomatic cover in Geneva, Switzerland, where he maintained computer network security, he told the Guardian.\nHis experience there and working alongside CIA officers gradually led him to question his own role in the government.\nWith time, Snowden told the Guardian, he could no longer live “unfreely but comfortably” as a well-paid infrastructure analyst for Booz Allen Hamilton, a company hired by the NSA to manage its surveillance system.\nHe said he was “willing to accept any risk” by revealing top secrets and left his live-in girlfriend behind.\nSnowden’s parents and sisters did not return phone calls or emails, nor did a 28-year-old woman named Lindsay A. Mills who lived at the same address with him in Maryland and Hawaii.\n“For those of you that know me without my superhero cape, you can probably understand why I’ll be refraining from blog posts for a while,” Mills, a dancer, wrote in a blog post on Monday. “At the moment, all I can feel is alone. And for the first time in my life I feel strong enough to be on my own.”\nLIBERTARIAN LEANINGS\nAmong the telling details on the public record was Snowden’s support for Ron Paul, the libertarian U.S. politician who has run unsuccessfully for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination. Campaign finance records showed Snowden twice donated $250 to Paul’s 2012 campaign, which was based largely on the principle that government has grown too meddlesome and intruded on personal freedom.\nWith little more information than that, sympathizers portrayed Snowden as a hero.\nA fund started on the online fundraising platform Crowdtilt had raised more than $8,100 by Monday afternoon, saying the cash would support Snowden for any expenses, such as hotels and airfare. Separately, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee said it was raising money for his legal defense. An online petition asking the White House to pardon Snowden accumulated some 26,550 signatures.\nThere was an angry backlash as well. Some denounced him as a anti-American spy. One U.S. counterterrorism official was worried by reports that Snowden handled or had access to CIA and NSA communications in Geneva and Japan, two vital listening posts.\n“He might be young, but this is not exactly a low-level guy. He’s privy to a lot. What scares me is what else he knows, and if the Chinese will get to him,” said the official, who is regularly briefed on reports under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe official noted that the information Snowden leaked was “top secret,” compared to lower-level “secret” information that Manning admitted he provided to WikiLeaks. “So this is a lot more damaging,” the official said.\n(This story has been corrected to fix spelling of Lindsay (not Lindsey) Mills in 24th paragraph)

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Internal Revenue Service official at the center of a scandal about extra tax scrutiny of conservative groups told Congress on Wednesday she had done nothing wrong but invoked her constitutional right not to answer questions.\nLois Lerner, who heads the IRS tax-exempt unit, angered lawmakers by reading a statement before refusing to testify, but she was dismissed from the hearing with a warning that she could be called back for another appearance before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n“I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any congressional committee,” Lerner told the panel.\n“Because I am asserting my right not to testify, I know that some people will assume that I have done something wrong. I have not,” she said.\nHouse Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican, said Lerner appeared to have waived her right against self-incrimination by making the statement. Republican Trey Gowdy of South Carolina demanded that she stay to answer questions, drawing applause from the crowd in the hearing room.\nAfter conferring with aides, Issa - who has accused Lerner of providing “false or misleading” information to Congress last year about the IRS’s treatment of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status - dismissed her from the hearing but said he might call her to testify in the future. Photographers swarmed Lerner as she left.\nLerner is at the center of a political scandal over the tax-collection agency’s use of search terms such as “Tea Party” and “patriots,” to select groups for additional scrutiny of their qualifications for tax-exempt status.\nThe tax agency’s “inappropriate” targeting of conservative groups, as described in a Treasury inspector general report released last week, has set off a political firestorm and led Republicans to question whether Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration was involved.\nThe scandal - along with others involving questions about the Justice Department’s tracking of reporters in investigations into national security leaks and an ongoing probe about the administration’s response to the deadly attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, in September - threatens to undercut Obama’s second-term agenda.\nThe president is trying to negotiate a budget deal with Republicans and push a comprehensive immigration reform bill through Congress.\nU.S. Director of Exempt Organizations for the Internal Revenue Service, Lois Lerner, takes her seat before a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on alleged targeting of political groups seeking tax-exempt status by the IRS, on Capitol Hill in Washington, May 22, 2013. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\nCongressional investigators have said Lerner was the Washington official who learned in June 2011 that workers in a Cincinnati, Ohio, office were using inappropriate criteria and ordered them changed.\nIssa and other lawmakers have complained that Lerner and other IRS officials knew of targeting by the IRS but did not inform Congress.\n‘FALSE OR MISLEADING’\nLerner made the IRS targeting public on May 10, sparking investigations by three congressional committees and a criminal probe by the Department of Justice.\nHer refusal to testify on Wednesday stymied attempts by Issa’s panel to learn who was responsible for initiating the targeting and supervising the targeting.\nAt the hearing, frustrated lawmakers repeatedly criticized former IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman and J. Russell George, who published a watchdog report on the practice last week, for not alerting Congress to the practice earlier.\nDemocratic Representative Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts warned their failure to be more forthcoming could require the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the scandal.\nIssa said an IRS internal review uncovered the policy of scrutinizing conservative groups in May 2012 and that top officials, including outgoing acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller, were made aware of the findings but did not alert Congress for nearly a year.\nSlideshow (2 Images)\nHe also questioned why George’s investigators looking into the targeting allowed IRS officials to be present during investigative interviews with subordinates and criticized the inspector general for waiting 10 months to give the committee information on the targeting.\nGeorge said it would have been “impractical for us to give you partial information that may not be accurate.”\nShulman repeated the testimony he gave a Senate hearing on Tuesday that he did not know the full details of the targeting for two years after it started in 2010. Issa told Shulman, “If you didn’t know, you were derelict in your duty.”\nRepresentative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the panel, criticized Shulman for not alerting Congress to the practice after testifying in March 2012 without mentioning it. He said it would have been “common sense” to “come back, even if it were a phone call or a letter.”\nIssa said the employees in the IRS tax-exempt unit “could have and should have been a whistleblower” on the targeting.\nShulman said he never discussed the targeting with anyone at the White House. Republican Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio noted that Shulman visited the White House 118 times during 2010 and 2011 and said it was surprising the issue would not have come up.\nShulman said he mostly talked about budget and tax issues, with the healthcare overhaul another frequent topic.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said recently. &ldquo;We need this program.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At the same time, however, the revelation of these programs has angered Republican-leaning libertarians, as well as some liberal Democrats who are themselves part of the president&rsquo;s base.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I don\'t think collecting millions and millions of Americans\' phone calls, now this is the metadata, this is time, place, to whom you direct the calls, is making us any safer,&rdquo; Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., said on NBC\'s &ldquo;Meet the Press.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For his part, Obama has embraced a national debate of these programs -- even if that conversation wouldn&rsquo;t have existed without the leak of these secret programs to the news media.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We do have to strike a balance, and we do have to be cautious about how our governments are operating when it comes to intelligence,&rdquo; he said on Wednesday at a news conference with Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel. &ldquo;And so this is a debate that I welcome.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><b>No evidence yet that IRS, Benghazi, and leak investigations go to the top</b><br>\n By comparison, the other three controversies -- concerning the IRS, the drafting of talking points on the terrorist attack in Benghazi and leak investigations involving journalists -- have yet to show a direct tie to the president or wrongdoing among his top political advisers, despite Republican efforts to prove otherwise.</p>\n<p>In fact, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, released testimony on Tuesday from a Cincinnati-based IRS front-line manager who appeared to dismiss the idea that the White House played a role in the agency&rsquo;s targeting of conservative-sounding groups applying for tax-exempt status.</p>\n<p>From the transcript of congressional investigators&rsquo; interview with this IRS employee, John Shafer, who described himself as a conservative Republican:</p>\n<blockquote> <p>Q: Do you have any reason to believe that anyone in the White House was involved in the decision to screen Tea Party cases?</p> <p>A: I have no reason to believe that.</p> <p>Q: Do you have any reason to believe that anyone in the White House was involved in the decision to centralize the review of Tea Party cases?</p> <p>A: I have no reason to believe that.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight Committee, howled at the release of the testimony. &ldquo;I am deeply disappointed that Ranking Member Cummings has decided to broadly disseminate and post online a 205 page transcript that will serve as a roadmap for IRS officials to navigate investigative interviews with Congress,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Republicans also point to the IRS employee&rsquo;s testimony that his answers &ldquo;no reason to believe that&rdquo; meant &ldquo;no personal knowledge.&rdquo;</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/130620-obama-4x3.380;380;7;70;0.jpg"></img></figure>\n<p>But Shafer&rsquo;s testimony confirmed the finding from the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2013reports/201310053fr.pdf">inspector general&rsquo;s report</a> on the IRS controversy, which concluded that the targeting wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;influenced by any individual or organization outside the IRS.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, when it comes to the drafting of talking points after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, congressional Republicans now have focused more on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her State Department, especially after the White House <a href="http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/15/18279922-white-house-releases-additional-documents-related-to-benghazi-response?lite">released the actual emails</a> developing those talking points.</p>\n<p>And the leak investigations involving journalists point to the Justice Department, not the White House.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The president and White House have been cabined-off from any wrongdoing here,&rdquo; a White House official tells First Read. &ldquo;And nothing in the facts so far contradicts that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t exonerate White House aides from making a series of missteps in handling these controversies -- whether it was <a href="http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/22/18420135-first-thoughts-the-white-houses-pr-mess?lite">not being initially forthcoming</a> about when it knew about the inspector general&rsquo;s report into the IRS targeting or suggesting that a <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/05/exclusive-benghazi-talking-points-underwent-12-revisions-scrubbed-of-terror-references/">single adjustment</a> was made to the Benghazi talking points (when more than one was made).</p>\n<p><b>GOP: \'There is still information we need\'</b><br>\n While a top Republican House aide admits that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;very possible&rdquo; the IRS, Benghazi and leak-investigation controversies don&rsquo;t go all the way up to the president, the aide says, &ldquo;There is still information we need.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Let the facts take us where they will,&rdquo; the aide adds.</p>\n<p>The GOP aide goes on to say that the Republican Party&rsquo;s goal with these investigations has never been to get an immediate touchdown. &ldquo;We are content to get three yards on a play.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Here is a status update on the four controversies over the past month:</p>\n<p><b>IRS</b><br>\n On May 10, IRS official Lois Lerner, a civil servant, revealed that the agency had targeted conservative-sounding groups applying for tax-exempt status. An <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/tigta/auditreports/2013reports/201310053fr.pdf">inspector general&rsquo;s report</a> confirmed that finding, but it also concluded that the targeting wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;influenced by any individual or organization outside the IRS.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>After the revelation, Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller announced his resignation; Obama appointed top budget official Danny Werfel to head the agency; and Lerner was placed on administrative leave (after invoking the 5<sup>th</sup> Amendment to a congressional committee).</p>\n<p>More recently, Rep. Issa&rsquo;s House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released partial testimony from Cincinnati-based IRS employees contending that Washington officials played a role in the targeting. But those Washington officials have never been tied to the Obama White House or its political team. What&rsquo;s more, Ranking Member Cummings released testimony showing a conservative IRS employee declaring that the White House had no role in the targeting.</p>\n<p><b>Benghazi</b><br>\n On the same day that Lerner first said the IRS had targeted conservative-sounding groups, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/05/exclusive-benghazi-talking-points-underwent-12-revisions-scrubbed-of-terror-references/">ABC News</a> reported on edits that the State Department and Obama administration had made to the &ldquo;talking points&rdquo; describing the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said recently. “We need this program.”\nAt the same time, however, the revelation of these programs has angered Republican-leaning libertarians, as well as some liberal Democrats who are themselves part of the president’s base.\n“I don\'t think collecting millions and millions of Americans\' phone calls, now this is the metadata, this is time, place, to whom you direct the calls, is making us any safer,” Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., said on NBC\'s “Meet the Press.”\nFor his part, Obama has embraced a national debate of these programs -- even if that conversation wouldn’t have existed without the leak of these secret programs to the news media.\n“We do have to strike a balance, and we do have to be cautious about how our governments are operating when it comes to intelligence,” he said on Wednesday at a news conference with Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel. “And so this is a debate that I welcome.”\nNo evidence yet that IRS, Benghazi, and leak investigations go to the top\nBy comparison, the other three controversies -- concerning the IRS, the drafting of talking points on the terrorist attack in Benghazi and leak investigations involving journalists -- have yet to show a direct tie to the president or wrongdoing among his top political advisers, despite Republican efforts to prove otherwise.\nIn fact, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, released testimony on Tuesday from a Cincinnati-based IRS front-line manager who appeared to dismiss the idea that the White House played a role in the agency’s targeting of conservative-sounding groups applying for tax-exempt status.\nFrom the transcript of congressional investigators’ interview with this IRS employee, John Shafer, who described himself as a conservative Republican:\nQ: Do you have any reason to believe that anyone in the White House was involved in the decision to screen Tea Party cases?\nA: I have no reason to believe that.\nQ: Do you have any reason to believe that anyone in the White House was involved in the decision to centralize the review of Tea Party cases?\nA: I have no reason to believe that.\nRep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight Committee, howled at the release of the testimony. “I am deeply disappointed that Ranking Member Cummings has decided to broadly disseminate and post online a 205 page transcript that will serve as a roadmap for IRS officials to navigate investigative interviews with Congress,” he said.\nRepublicans also point to the IRS employee’s testimony that his answers “no reason to believe that” meant “no personal knowledge.”\nBut Shafer’s testimony confirmed the finding from the inspector general’s report on the IRS controversy, which concluded that the targeting wasn’t “influenced by any individual or organization outside the IRS.”\nMeanwhile, when it comes to the drafting of talking points after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, congressional Republicans now have focused more on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her State Department, especially after the White House released the actual emails developing those talking points.\nAnd the leak investigations involving journalists point to the Justice Department, not the White House.\n“The president and White House have been cabined-off from any wrongdoing here,” a White House official tells First Read. “And nothing in the facts so far contradicts that.”\nBut that doesn’t exonerate White House aides from making a series of missteps in handling these controversies -- whether it was not being initially forthcoming about when it knew about the inspector general’s report into the IRS targeting or suggesting that a single adjustment was made to the Benghazi talking points (when more than one was made).\nGOP: \'There is still information we need\'\nWhile a top Republican House aide admits that it’s “very possible” the IRS, Benghazi and leak-investigation controversies don’t go all the way up to the president, the aide says, “There is still information we need.”\n“Let the facts take us where they will,” the aide adds.\nThe GOP aide goes on to say that the Republican Party’s goal with these investigations has never been to get an immediate touchdown. “We are content to get three yards on a play.”\nHere is a status update on the four controversies over the past month:\nIRS\nOn May 10, IRS official Lois Lerner, a civil servant, revealed that the agency had targeted conservative-sounding groups applying for tax-exempt status. An inspector general’s report confirmed that finding, but it also concluded that the targeting wasn’t “influenced by any individual or organization outside the IRS.”\nAfter the revelation, Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller announced his resignation; Obama appointed top budget official Danny Werfel to head the agency; and Lerner was placed on administrative leave (after invoking the 5th Amendment to a congressional committee).\nMore recently, Rep. Issa’s House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released partial testimony from Cincinnati-based IRS employees contending that Washington officials played a role in the targeting. But those Washington officials have never been tied to the Obama White House or its political team. What’s more, Ranking Member Cummings released testimony showing a conservative IRS employee declaring that the White House had no role in the targeting.\nBenghazi\nOn the same day that Lerner first said the IRS had targeted conservative-sounding groups, ABC News reported on edits that the State Department and Obama administration had made to the “talking points” describing the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya. The edits included removing references to Ansar al-Sharia to not hinder the investigation into the attack, and changing a reference to the Benghazi location as a "mission" or "diplomatic post," rather than a consulate.\nBut when the White House released the actual emails, they revealed more agency politics (between the State Department and CIA) than electoral politics (which Republican critics had alleged). In fact, the emails showed White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes urging his colleagues to ensure they had the right information. "There is a ton of wrong information getting out into the public domain from Congress and people who are not particularly informed," Rhodes wrote. “Insofar as we have firmed up assessments that don\'t compromise intel or the investigation, we need to have the capability to correct the record, as there are significant policy and messaging ramifications that would flow from a hardened mis-impression.\nRepublicans, however, pointed their finger at the State Department for wanting to change the talking points. “The seemingly political nature of the State Department’s concerns raises questions about the motivations behind these changes and who at the State Department was seeking them,” said a spokesman for Republican House Speaker John Boehner.\nLeak investigations\nAfter the IRS and Benghazi stories surfaced last month, The Associated Press revealed that the Justice Department secretly obtained phone records of AP reporters and editors in pursuing a national-security leak. Then another story dropped: The Justice Department labeled a Fox News reporter as a “co-conspirator” in a separate leak case.\nAfter criticism of the Justice Department’s actions, President Obama called for Congress to pass a media-shield law, and he also instructed the Justice Department to conduct a review of guidelines about investigations regarding reporters -- due to the president by July 12. “Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs,” Obama said in his national-security speech last month. “Our focus must be on those who break the law.”\nNSA surveillance\nOn June 5, Glenn Greenwald of the Guardian newspaper reported that the U.S. government has collected American’s phone records and other meta-data, and the government later revealed it was part of a National Security Agency program dating back to 2006.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Struggling to salvage a massive surveillance program, President Barack Obama faced congressional critics of the National Security Agency\'s collection of Americans\' telephone records Thursday as snowballing concerns made new limitations on the intelligence effort appear increasingly likely.\nObama and Vice President Joe Biden joined lawmakers on both sides of the issue for an Oval Office meeting designed to stem the bleeding of public support and show Obama was serious about engaging. Among the participants were the NSA\'s most vigorous congressional supporters — the top Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate intelligence panels — alongside its most stern critics, including Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado.\nThe lawmakers departed the rainy White House grounds without speaking to reporters. But in interviews later, they said there was a consensus that the surveillance efforts are suffering from perception problems that have undercut trust among the American people.\n"There is openness to making changes," said Rep. C.A. "Dutch" Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.\nSen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, top Republican on the Senate\'s intelligence panel and a strong NSA defender, said Obama and the lawmakers didn\'t agree to take specific steps but brought up a number of proposals that will be fleshed out over the August congressional recess.\n"A lot of ideas were thrown out," Chambliss told The Associated Press. "Nothing was concluded."\nWyden, in an interview, said he and Udall had sought to convince Obama of the urgency of addressing rising concerns. He said he proposed strengthening the government\'s ability to get emergency authorization to collect an individual\'s phone records, so that pre-emptive collection of everyone\'s records would no longer be necessary.\n"I felt that the president was open to ideas — and we\'re going to make sure he has some," Wyden said after returning to Capitol Hill.\nWyden and two Senate colleagues also unveiled legislation Thursday to overhaul the secret federal court that oversees the programs, which critics decry as largely a rubber stamp. The senators aim to make the court created under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, more adversarial by creating a special advocate who could argue for privacy during closed-door proceedings and appeal decisions. A companion bill would diversify the court\'s bench by ending the chief justice\'s sole authority to pick its judges.\n"These bills do not compromise national security, but they put a necessary opposing view in the FISA court and assure ideological diversity of judges," said Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M. Another of the bill\'s sponsors, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the Obama administration was receptive to the ideas, although White House officials declined to comment.\nDebate over the line between counterterrorism and invasion of privacy has been heating up since former government contract systems analyst Edward Snowden leaked classified documents exposing the NSA\'s monumental capability to sweep up data about phone and Internet use, including programs that store years of phone records on virtually every American. Snowden\'s revelations have prompted a national rethinking over government surveillance powers that have grown since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\nRussia decided on Thursday to grant temporary asylum to Snowden, who has been in a Moscow airport hotel for more than a month, despite America\'s insistence that the fugitive be sent home to face prosecution on espionage charges.\nIn Washington, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said he stressed to Obama the role Congress must play in ensuring that U.S. spying isn\'t infringing on Congress\' intent or on civil liberties. He said his committee would further probe the issue, including in a classified hearing he\'s hoping to hold in September.\nExtending its efforts to defend the programs to the public, the White House pledged to help Americans understand as much as possible about how they work, even as it staunchly defended their efficacy in keeping a post-9/11 America safe.\n"That process will continue," said White House spokesman Jay Carney. "But I don\'t think that we can sensibly say that programs designed to protect us from terrorist attack are not necessary in this day and age."\nThe more information about the programs the government has released, the more it has fed even greater concerns about the scope of the surveillance and whether Obama\'s national security team has been truthful in describing it publicly in the past.\nAfter the administration on Wednesday declassified more documents about an email mining program, Wyden said they showed the government had "repeatedly made inaccurate statements to Congress" about the effectiveness in countering terrorism. And new details released about the phone records program created new fodder for critics by confirming for the first time that, when investigating one suspected terrorist, the government can also examine records of people who called people who called the targeted individual — netting millions of people\'s records in a single request.\nMeanwhile, the head of the NSA openly clashed with lawmakers including Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., over the agency\'s statements that telephone and email data collection helped foil 54 terror plots.\nRising tensions have stoked concern at the White House that surveillance programs Obama considers crucial will soon be undermined or even dismantled — despite the fact that many Democrats and Republicans in Congress have come to the NSA\'s defense.\nLeahy, the Judiciary Committee chairman, has threatened to seek to end the phone records program if it\'s not proven effective. And Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., signaled Thursday that unless an agreement is reached on releasing more of the secret court\'s opinions, he would push Congress to use its "power of the purse" to compel their disclosure by withholding funding for certain programs.\nEven some staunch advocates for a tough national security stance have become outspoken critics, including Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who helped write the USA Patriot Act but now says the phone records collection goes far beyond what he envisioned and may not be renewed. Sensenbrenner was among the lawmakers who shared concerns in the session Thursday with Obama and top officials, including Biden, National Security Advisory Susan Rice and White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler.\nThe White House also was spooked by a House vote last week to dismantle the program, which failed by a narrow 217-205 margin.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Richard Lardner contributed to this report.\n___

As President Obama nominates a new FBI director, the bureau is coming under rising pressure from lawmakers to explain the limits of its recently disclosed drone fleet.\nCivil liberties-minded senators on both sides of the aisle have fired off sharply worded letters and statements in recent days criticizing the FBI for deploying surveillance drones without clear guidance on how to protect privacy rights.\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the latest to scrutinize the bureau, sending a letter on Thursday to outgoing Director Robert Mueller asking a string of questions about his agency\'s drone use.\n"I am disturbed by the revelation that the FBI has unilaterally decided to begin using drone surveillance technology without a governance policy, and thus without the requisite assurances that the constitutional rights of Americans are being protected," Paul wrote.\nMueller acknowledged Wednesday, during a Senate hearing, that the bureau has a limited number of drones that it uses for surveillance on U.S. soil. He stressed they are used in a "very, very minimal way and very seldom." Newly released documents show that the FBI has sought and received permission from the FAA at least four times to fly surveillance drones inside the U.S. since 2010.\nThe use of non-lethal drones for surveillance purposes is rapidly getting off the ground among local law enforcement agencies and other groups. Mueller, in acknowledging that the FBI, too, has obtained surveillance drones, said the bureau is in the "initial stages" of drafting rules and regulations for their use.\nSen. Mark Udall, D-Colo., took umbrage at that fact, saying that while drones have the potential to help law enforcement agencies, constitutional rights must come first.\n"I am concerned the FBI is deploying drone technology while only being in the \'initial stages\' of developing guidelines to protect Americans\' privacy rights. I look forward to learning more about this program and will do everything in my power to hold the FBI accountable and ensure its actions respect the U.S. Constitution," he said in a statement.\nThe FBI clarified on Friday that its drone use is governed by existing bureau regulations and FAA rules. It confirmed that the specific drone model is the PUMA AE, manufactured by California firm AeroVironment. The model is hand-launched, battery-powered and can send live color and thermal video to its operator, according to the company. It is designed to respond to disasters and other incidents.\nThe issue is likely to follow Obama\'s new nominee to lead the FBI, Jim Comey. Obama nominated the former federal prosecutor on Friday.\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who originally asked Mueller about the drone program, also wrote a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday seeking "clarification" regarding a prior response from the department that did not disclose the FBI\'s drones. He, too, asked Holder to explain when the FBI began using them, what checks are in place for the program and whether any are capable of being armed.\nFBI spokesman Paul Bresson clarified earlier this week that the aircraft are only used in "very limited circumstances to support operations where there was a specific operational need."\nHe cited an example of a hostage situation in Alabama earlier this year where a drone helped law enforcement. He said they are only used to conduct surveillance "on stationary subjects." And the bureau must obtain FAA approval first.

Alex Wong / Getty Images\nPresident Barack Obama speaks during a joint news conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron at White House on Monday.\nOutrage intensified in Washington on Monday over the disclosure that the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative groups for special scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status.\nPresident Barack Obama, at a White House appearance with the British prime minister, said that he wanted all the facts but used strong terms to condemn the reported conduct.\n“I’ve got no patience with it. I will not tolerate it,” he said. “And we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this.”\nThe Treasury Department’s inspector general for tax administration will release an audit report later this week. In the meantime, here are five big unanswered questions looming over the IRS.\nHow did this start and why?\nIn January 2010, a Supreme Court decision known as Citizens United touched off a flood of political spending, much of it classified under a section of tax law known as 501(c)4 that entitles certain “social welfare” groups to tax exemption.\nTwo months later, a special unit of the IRS in Cincinnati assigned to screen applications for 501(c)4 status began searching for groups with descriptions that included “Tea Party” and “Patriots,” according to a partial draft of the inspector general’s report obtained by NBC News.\nLois Lerner, head of the IRS division on tax-exempt organizations, said Friday that the targeting of conservative groups was “inappropriate” but “absolutely not” influenced by the White House. She also said that none of the targeted groups was denied tax-exempt status.\nWhat has not been spelled out is who in the Cincinnati office decided to search for conservative groups and why.\nAt least one Tea Party group called on the administration Monday to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the matter, which it called “un-American and Nixonesque.” One of the articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon accused him of targeting political opponents for tax audits.\nBoth Republicans and Democrats in Congress are determined to investigate.\n“I just don’t buy that this was a couple of rogue IRS employees,” Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Sunday on the CNN program “State of the Union.”\nWho knew what, and when, higher in the IRS?\nLerner learned in June 2011 that agents had targeted groups with names including “Tea Party” and “Patriots,” according to the draft obtained by NBC News.\nShe “instructed that the criteria immediately be revised,” according to the draft. Ten months later, in March 2012, the IRS commissioner at the time, Douglas Shulman, testified to Congress that the IRS was not targeting tax-exempt groups based on their politics.\nThe IRS said over the weekend that senior executives were not aware of the targeting, but it remains unclear who knew what and when. Shulman, who left the agency last fall, has not spoken publicly about the scandal and did not answer a request for comment Monday from NBC News.\nMembers of Congress had sent letters to Shulman as early as June 2011 asking specifically about targeting of conservative groups, according to a House Ways and Means Committee summary obtained by NBC News.\nThe IRS responded at least six times but made no mention of targeting conservatives, according to the committee’s summary.\nWill anyone be fired?\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on Monday demanded the resignation of the head of the IRS. That is Steven Miller, who is serving as acting commissioner until Obama nominates a replacement.\nThe last commissioner was Shulman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2008, left the agency in November and has taken a position as a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution.\nNewt Gingrich, the Republican former House speaker, told MSNBC on Monday that Obama should say “he’s going to fire everybody he can legally fire who’s been involved with this.”\nHow will the White House contain the political damage?\nThe IRS scandal presents a daunting political challenge for the White House, which is already being forced to defend its handling of the deadly attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, last September.\nThe furor over the IRS has come from both parties. Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Monday the agency had committed an “outrageous abuse of power” and pledged a grilling.\n“The IRS will now be the ones put under additional scrutiny,” he said.\nSen. Tim Kaine of Virginia called it inexcusable, and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said the president “must immediately condemn this attack on our values and find those individuals in his administration who are responsible and fire them.”\nHow can this be prevented in the future?\nRubio, in his letter calling for the resignation of the IRS chief, called the behavior “seemingly unconstitutional and potentially criminal.”\nBut under existing law, the worst that can happen to an IRS agent who discriminates against taxpayers is getting fired, said Rep. Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican who sits on the House Oversight Committee.\nTurner introduced a bill Monday to increase the toughest penalty to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.\n“This is about protecting the rights of all Americans and their ability to freely express their political thoughts,” he said.\nKelly O’Donnell of NBC News contributed to this report. Reuters and The Associated Press also contributed.\nThis story was originally published on Mon May 13, 2013 5:18 PM E

What’s worse for the Obama White House: For the controversies to be full-scale scandals that go all the way to the top?... Or for them to be the result of bureaucratic incompetence?... The latest IRS developments… On Obama’s Morehouse speech… Two unions now oppose the Senate immigration bill… Getting the Hillary ’08 band back together -- or not… And Virginia, meet E.W. Jackson.\nPresident Barack Obama crosses the South Lawn as he returns from travel to Atlanta via Marine One, at the White House, May 19, 2013.\n*** Scandal or bureaucratic incompetency? Here’s a question for the Obama White House to ponder: What’s worse, for all the controversies -- especially the IRS targeting conservative-sounding groups -- to be a full-fledged scandal that goes all the way to the top? Or for them to be the result of bureaucratic incompetence? You could make an argument that the latter outcome could be just as damaging to the president, because it raises doubts about his competency and the public’s trust in government. As Time’s Joe Klein wrote last week, “It can, and will, be argued that the president is to blame for lousy management… Some in the Administration are saying that civil-service rules prevent Obama from firing the midlevel bozos. But what about the higher-ups? Why haven't the Democrats proposed a full-scale review of civil-service laws…? Such laws certainly hinder effective governance, which the Democrats are supposedly selling.” Of course, there are plenty of examples where you can argue that government has worked. Think of the rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy. Or the response to the Boston bombings. But government working in a crisis vs. government working every day are two different issues. And it’s never a good story when a White House has to respond to examples when the government ISN’T working for the American people.\n*** Competency questions pile up: After all, the Democrats are the party of government, and Obama got elected, in part, by pushing competency (at least compared with the previous administration). The White House should hope its problems are political in nature, because that’s something they’ve proven adept at dealing with. But the competency questions for this administration are piling up: The Veteran’s Administration is a mess; their explanation on Benghazi is about the lack of communication and security procedures; and the IRS explanation is overworked and mistake-prone bureaucrats in Cincinnati. Right now, the White House is benefitting from those congressional Republicans who are desperately searching for “scandal.” What the White House should fear more is if Republicans use their “government is too big” argument to go to core of competency.\n*** The latest IRS developments: It’s worth noting that today’s “news” about the White House counsel being informed of the IRS audit was first confirmed at a Jay Carney press briefing last week. A senior administration also confirms to NBC News that White House Counsel Kathy Ruemmler did NOT inform the president. What’s not clear is if she gave a heads up to the rest of the senior staff. And what’s also not clear is how much detail Ruemmler was offered about the audit itself. Meanwhile, the Sunday New York Times offered a lengthy piece tracing what went wrong in that Cincinnati IRS office. “While there are still many gaps in the story of how the I.R.S. scandal happened, interviews with current and former employees and with lawyers who dealt with them, along with a review of I.R.S. documents, paint a more muddled picture of an understaffed Cincinnati outpost that was alienated from the broader I.R.S. culture and given little direction. Overseen by a revolving cast of midlevel managers, stalled by miscommunication with I.R.S. lawyers and executives in Washington and confused about the rules they were enforcing, the Cincinnati specialists flagged virtually every application with Tea Party in its name. But their review went beyond conservative groups: more than 400 organizations came under scrutiny, including at least two dozen liberal-leaning ones and some that were seemingly apolitical.”\n*** Obama’s Morehouse speech: Also on Sunday, President Obama delivered a very personal commencement address at Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA. “Keep setting an example for what it means to be a man,” he told the graduates at the historically black college. “Be the best husband to your wife, or you’re your boyfriend, or your partner. Be the best father you can be to your children. Because nothing is more important.” The president added, “I was raised by a heroic single mom, wonderful grandparents -- made incredible sacrifices for me… But I sure wish I had had a father who was not only present, but involved. Didn’t know my dad. And so my whole life, I’ve tried to be for Michelle and my girls what my father was not for my mother and me. I want to break that cycle where a father is not at home, where a father is not helping to raise that son or daughter. “I want to be a better father, a better husband, a better man.” And pair Obama’s commencement address with the one his wife delivered on Friday at another historically black college (Bowie State): “Instead of dreaming of being a teacher or a lawyer or a business leader, they’re fantasizing about being a baller or a rapper… Please reject the slander that says a black child with a book is trying to act white.”\n*** Two unions now oppose Senate immigration legislation: On the topic of immigration… The National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, a union representing 12,000 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officers, “will publicly oppose the Senate Gang of Eight immigration plan Monday, giving critics of the overhaul effort additional political ammunition as they work to defeat legislation working its way through the Senate Judiciary Committee,” NBC’s Carrie Dann reports. The reason for the opposition: The union believes the legislation “would fail to address an ‘insurmountable bureaucracy’ at the federal agency overseeing immigration documents.” Dann adds that this union joins the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council in its opposition to the Gang of Eight measure.\n*** Getting the band back together -- or not: It should be hardly surprising that folks like Howard Wolfson, Patti Solis Doyle, and Mark Penn would NOT work on a Hillary Clinton presidential campaign if she decides to run in 2016, as the Washington Post reports. After all, none of these people went on to join her at the State Department like other trusted Hillary Inc. aides did. What’s more, Solis Doyle was sacked as campaign manager after Clinton lost Iowa. If Clinton runs, it would likely be a combination of trusted former aides, as well as some new blood. That’s often true for plenty of repeat presidential candidates. Yet there’s another way to look at this Washington Post piece: It’s a message to many outside of Hillary World, especially those who were critical of the ’08 Hillary campaign, that the whole band won’t be getting back together if she runs in ’16. And those folks might see this as a positive development.\n*** Meet E.W. Jackson: Virginia Republicans this year are conducting an intriguing experiment in Virginia, a state Obama has twice carried in presidential contests, that’s elected Democrats to U.S. Senate seats the last three times senate elections have been held: Can it win in 2013 with a ticket of candidates who are best known for being VERY conservative and VERY outspoken on social issues? Well, here is E.W. Jackson, a black minister who was nominated to be the GOP’s Lt. Gov. nominee joining Ken Cuccinelli at the top of the ticket. “The newly minted Republican nominee for lieutenant governor of Virginia once compared Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan and bemoaned black voters’ ‘slavish devotion’ to the Democratic Party — past statements that are likely to inflame the culture-war politics of the state’s 2013 elections,” Politico writes. Indeed, Jackson makes Cuccinelli look moderate on social issues. And this is what happens when you nominate candidates via a convention rather than a primary. Does anyone think that Jackson would have won the GOP’s Lt. Gov. primary? For what it’s worth, the nomination of Cuccinelli as attorney general four years ago was seen by some Republicans as a problem (and a potential opportunity for the Democrats). As it turned out, the top of the ticket could shield itself at the time. Of course, “LG” is more of a “running mate” feel and will be more difficult for Cuccinelli to shield himself from Jackson.\nClick here to sign up for First Read emails.\nText FIRST to 622639, to sign up for First Read alerts to your mobile phone.\nCheck us out on Facebook and also on Twitter.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who accused the Obama administration of Nixon-style dirty tricks last year, said Friday that the Internal Revenue Service\'s targeting of conservative groups is part of a broader government assault on free speech.\nMcConnell, R-Ky., seized on the spate of controversies besetting the White House, saying Americans are recognizing a pattern of attack on First Amendment rights across government agencies, the administration, President Obama\'s congressional allies, left-wing groups and public-employee unions.\n"As serious as the IRS scandal is, what we\'re dealing with here is larger than the actions of one agency or any group of employees," McConnell, who is up for re-election next year, said in a speech to the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "This administration has institutionalized the practice of pitting bureaucrats against the very people they\'re supposed to be serving, and it needs to stop."\nSpeaking to the same organization last year, McConnell accused the administration and Obama\'s re-election campaign of leaking tax information and maintaining an enemies list in a chilling style reminiscent of President Richard Nixon, the Republican who resigned in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal.\nIn the first six months of Obama\'s second term, the administration\'s problems have produced an assortment of political targets for Republicans. One is the IRS affair, which has resulted in resignations and departures from the agency. No evidence has come to light that anyone in the Obama administration outside the IRS was involved in targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status.\nOther issues facing the Obama administration this year include government surveillance of phone and Internet records; its handling of last year\'s terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans; the Justice Department\'s seizure of phone records of journalists at the Associated Press and, in another case, reading the e-mails of Fox News reporter James Rosen.\nMcConnell referred to the IRS episode with a bit of I-told-you-so.\n"When I warned about all this last year, I got slammed by the usual suspects on the left. They said I was full of it," he said. "But even some of them now seem to realize that just because McConnell is the one pulling the alarm doesn\'t mean there isn\'t a fire. The IRS scandal has reminded people of the temptations to abuse that big government, and its political patrons, are prone to. People are waking up to a pattern here."\nIn comments certain to appeal to Republican voters, McConnell described public sector unions as power hungry and able to expand their reach with the help of congressional friends. He said the unions no longer serve the public\'s interest but rather the government\'s.\n"There\'s no better illustration of this than the announcement this week that in the midst of congressional hearings into their activities, unionized employees at the IRS are about to get $70 million in bonuses," McConnell said.\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said this week that the IRS plans to hand out $70 million in bonuses to employees. Under a contract with the employees\' union, IRS workers can receive individual performance bonuses of up to $3,500 a year.\nIn response to Grassley\'s criticism, the agency said it\'s under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement with the National Treasury Employees Union. The agency and the union say they are in negotiations over the matter.\nMcConnell used the speech to deliver a forceful defense of the Supreme Court\'s 2010 Citizens United ruling, which lifted many restrictions on corporate spending in political elections.

MOSCOW (AP) — Former National Security Agency systems analyst Edward Snowden says surveillance programs used by the United States to tap into phone and Internet connections around the world are making people less safe.\nIn short video clips posted by the WikiLeaks website on Friday, Snowden said the NSA mass surveillance he revealed before fleeing to Russia "puts us at risk of coming into conflict with our own government."\nSnowden, who faces espionage charges in the U.S. over the leak, described the techniques as "dragnet mass surveillance that puts entire populations under sort of an eye that sees everything even when it\'s not needed."\n"They hurt our economy. They hurt our country. They limit our ability to speak and think and live and be creative, to have relationships and to associate freely," Snowden said.\nThe videos are the first of Snowden speaking since July 12, when he was shown at a Moscow airport pleading with Russian authorities to grant him asylum, which they did on Aug. 1.\nThat decision has strained the relations between the U.S. and Russia. President Barack Obama called off a meeting with President Vladimir Putin at a summit hosted by Russia in September.\nSnowden said the U.S. government was "unwilling to prosecute high officials who lied to Congress and the country on camera, but they\'ll stop at nothing to persecute someone who told them the truth."\nIn a note accompanying the videos, WikiLeaks said Snowden spoke on Wednesday in Moscow as he accepted the Sam Adams Award, given annually by a group of retired U.S. national security officers and named for a CIA analyst during the Vietnam War who accused the U.S. military of deliberately underestimating the enemy\'s strength for political purposes.\nFour former U.S. government officials who were at the ceremony told The Associated Press on Thursday that Snowden is adjusting to life in Russia and said they saw no evidence that he was under the control of local security services. They refused to say where they met with Snowden or where he is living.

President Barack Obama has apologised to the California attorney general for remarking on her appearance at a fundraising event on Thursday.\nMr Obama described Kamala Harris, a long-time friend, as "the best-looking attorney general in the country".\nMs Harris\'s spokesman said she strongly supported Mr Obama but would not say whether she had accepted his apology.\nCritics have cited the remark as an example of the ongoing hurdles women face in the workplace.\nIf the compliment police are going to descend every time a pleasantry is offered, well then the heck with \'feminism\'Jennifer Rubin, Washington Post\nUS media react to Obama \'sexism\'\nSpeaking after Ms Harris at the fundraising event in California on Thursday, Mr Obama said she was "brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough, and she is exactly what you\'d want in anybody who is administering the law and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake".\nThen he added: "She also happens to be by far the best-looking attorney general in the country... It\'s true. Come on. And she is a great friend and has just been a great supporter for many, many years."\nOn Friday, the White House said the president had spoken to the attorney general to apologise for the "distraction" created by his comments.\n"He did not want in any way to diminish the attorney general\'s professional accomplishments and her capabilities," press secretary Jay Carney said.\nHe added that the president "fully recognises the challenge women continue to face in the workplace and that they should not be judged based on appearance".\nWriters and bloggers have commented that although the president is a personal friend of Ms Harris and a strong supporter of women\'s rights, his remarks were inappropriate.

President Barack Obama has commuted the sentences of eight Americans who would have had shorter prison terms under current drug sentencing laws.\nEach of the six men and two women had served more than 15 years in prison for charges related to crack cocaine.\nA 2010 law reduced the disparity in sentencing between crack and powdered cocaine offences.\nAnd in August, the administration dropped mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders.\nCritics say that heavy drug sentences have hit minorities hardest.\n\'Too late\'\nIn a statement, Mr Obama said the 2010 law, the Fair Sentencing Act, had begun "to right a decades-old injustice, but for thousands of inmates, it came too late".\n"Instead, because of a disparity in the law that is now recognised as unjust, they remain in prison, separated from their families and their communities, at a cost of millions of taxpayer dollars each year."\nSome 47% of US prison inmates have been incarcerated for drug offences, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\nMany of those with newly commuted sentences were young when they received lengthy prison terms. Six of those on the commutation list had been sentenced to life in prison.\nMost will be released in April. One man will go free immediately and another will be released in 2018.\nAmong those ending their prison terms:\nReynolds Wintersmith, a first-time drug offender who rejected a plea deal after his arrest aged 19 in 1994\nStephanie George, who received a life sentence in 1997 for charges stemming from crack cocaine her boyfriend stored in her loft\nClarence Aaron, who first applied for clemency in 2001 after being sentenced to a life term in 1993 in a case where he did not buy or sell the drugs in question. A pardon attorney reportedly left out new, key information in the 2008 version of Aaron\'s bid for clemency to the White House\nBefore this, Mr Obama had commuted only one sentence in the five years of his presidency, also involving another drug case, and had pardoned 39 people.\nOn Thursday, the president also pardoned 13 others for various crimes. All had already served their full prison terms.\nA pardon forgives a crime and wipes out the conviction, while a commutation leaves the conviction but ends the punishment.\nIn August, US Attorney General Eric Holder announced a major shift in federal sentencing policies, targeting long mandatory terms that he said have flooded the nation\'s prisons with low-level drug offenders and diverted crime-fighting dollars that could be far better spent.\nAnd a bill in Congress would apply the Fair Sentencing Act to some drug offenders already in prison, allowing potential clemency to a group of people estimated to be in the thousands by advocacy groups.

SPRINGFIELD --- The Senate today approved legislation that would allow doctors to prescribe medical marijuana to patients with serious illnesses, sending the measure to Gov. Pat Quinn.\nThe issue pitted supporters arguing for compassion for those suffering from pain they say only cannabis can ease against opponents who contend the legislation would undermine public safety.\nSponsoring Sen. Bill Haine, D-Alton, argued the measure is one of the toughest in the nation. Haine said his bill does not reflect other states that have "sloppily" instituted medical marijuana laws.\n"This bill is filled with walls to keep this limited," said Haine, a former Madison County state\'s attorney.\nSen. Kyle McCarter, R-Lebanon, raised concerns about lawmakers endorsing a product that classified as a controlled substance by the federal government, arguing marijuana is a gateway drug that could lead users to harder substances.\n"For every touching story we have heard about the benefits to those in pain, I remind you today that there are a thousand time more parents who will never be relieved from the pain of losing a child due to addiction which in many cases started with the very illegal, FDA-unapproved addiction-forming drug that you are asking us to now make a normal part of our communities," McCarter said.\nThe proposal would create a four-year trial program in which doctors could prescribe patients no more than 2.5 ounces of marijuana every two weeks. To qualify, patients must have one of 42 serious or chronic conditions -- including cancer, multiple sclerosis or HIV -- and an established relationship with a doctor.\nPatients would undergo fingerprinting and a criminal background check and would be banned from using marijuana in public and around minors. Patients also could not legally grow marijuana, and they would have to buy it from one of 60 dispensing centers across Illinois. The state would license 22 growers.\nThe measure drew strong opposition from the Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police and the Illinois Sheriffs\' Association, which sent a letter to the governor and lawmakers warning the proposal would not stop medical marijuana card holders from driving while under the influence. They suggested blood and urine testing be included in the legislation to allow police to determine whether card holders had marijuana in their system while driving.\nHaine argued the law has safeguards to prevent that, including designating on a driver\'s license whether they use medical marijuana.\nThe Senate vote was 35-21, with 30 needed to pass the bill. It goes to Quinn, who has not indicated whether he will sign it. The Democratic governor recently said he is open minded to the legislation.

A group of ex-US drug enforcement chiefs say Washington must crack down on marijuana use in two states that recently voted to legalise the drug.\nEight former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) leaders urged the Obama administration to sue the states.\nIn November, Colorado and Washington state voters legalised marijuana, which is still banned under federal law.\nAnalysts say targeting recreational users is not a top enforcement priority for the US justice department.\nIn a letter released to the news media, the former DEA chiefs say President Barack Obama\'s justice department must act swiftly to counteract the state laws.\nAnd they called on senators to ask Attorney General Eric Holder, an Obama appointee, why the federal government had not already taken action when he testifies in Congress on Wednesday.\nUnder the US Constitution, federal law trumps state law, and the US is bound by international treaty to keep cannabis illegal, argue the former DEA chiefs, who worked under both Democratic and Republican presidents.\nIn the two states where voters have legalised recreational cannabis use, "the process of writing regulations is underway and it will become harder to rescind the legislation," Peter Bensinger, who ran the DEA under Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, told the BBC.\n\'Scare tactics\'\nHe added the Obama administration should sue Colorado and Washington state as it recently had the state of Arizona over an immigration measure it deemed clashed with federal law.\nMr Bensinger warned that full implementation of the legalisation laws would "cause havoc" in the communities, schools and roads of Colorado and Washington state.\n"The highways would be littered with fatalities because you\'re going to have increased use and marijuana stays in the body much longer than alcohol," Mr Bensinger said.\nBut Sanho Tree, a drug policy analyst who supports legalisation, said the former DEA chiefs\' warnings were "scare tactics".\nTheir letter is an attempt to goad the Obama administration into a show-down with the states in the Supreme Court, said Mr Tree, director of the drug policy project at the Institute for Policy Studies.\n"Most of these drug policy statements are about turf, which is really about budgets," said Mr Tree. He said drug enforcement agencies were attempting to "maintain a monopoly on doctrine".\nHe said the federal government must be realistic about changing attitudes towards the drug, and he said that in states with medical marijuana laws in place, critics\' worst fears had not come to pass.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Former Mexican President Vicente Fox took his crusade to legalize marijuana to San Francisco on Monday, joining pot advocates to urge the United States and his own country to decriminalize the sale and recreational use of cannabis.\nFox met for three hours with the advocates, including Steve DeAngelo, the Oakland-based executive director of California’s largest marijuana dispensary, and former Microsoft executive Jamen Shively, who hopes to create a Seattle-based pot brand now that Washington state has legalized recreational use.\nLegalization, Fox told reporters after the meeting, is the only way to end the violence of Mexican drug cartels, which he blamed on America’s war on drugs.\n“The cost of the war is becoming unbearable - too high for Mexico, for Latin America and for the rest of the world,” Fox said in English.\nEvery day, he said, 40 young people are killed in drug-related violence.\nFox’s position on legalizing drugs has evolved over time since the days when he cooperated with U.S. efforts to tamp down production in Mexico during his 2000-2006 presidential term. He has been increasingly vocal in his opposition to current policies, backing two prior efforts to legalize marijuana in Mexico.\nMexico’s current president, Enrique Peña Nieto, has opposed legalization. But he recently said that he would consider world opinion on the matter, particularly in light of recent voter-approved initiatives to legalize marijuana in Washington state and Colorado for recreational use.\nIn San Francisco on Monday, Fox said he had signed on to attend and help develop an international summit later this month in Mexico to strategize a path to end marijuana prohibition.\nParticipants scheduled to attend the three-day meeting starting July 18 in San Cristobal include an American surgeon, the dean of Harvard’s School of Public Health and a Mexican congressman who plans to introduce a bill to legalize marijuana in Mexico this summer, Fox said.\nThe bill, which he expects to be introduced by Mexican lawmaker Fernando Belaunzaran, would legalize adult recreational use of marijuana, Fox said.\nSupport for legalizing marijuana in the United States has been growing. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have passed medical marijuana laws, according to the pro-legalization National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. But the drug remains illegal under federal law.\nLifting the prohibition on cannabis in Mexico, however, appears to face more of an uphill battle. Mexican lawmakers have rejected previous legalization efforts and polls have shown little popular support for the idea.\nBut Fox promised to wage what he said was a necessary battle.\n“We cannot afford more blood and the loss of more young people,” Fox said. “We must get out of the trap we are in.”

(Reuters) - Retired Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy is taking aim at what he sees as knee-jerk support for marijuana legalization among his fellow liberals, in a project that carries special meaning for the self-confessed former Oxycontin addict.\nFormer U.S. Congressman Patrick Kennedy applauds at the groundbreaking ceremony for The Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate in honor of his father in Boston, Massachusetts, in this April 8, 2011 file photo. Kennedy is taking aim at what he sees as knee-jerk support for marijuana legalization among fellow liberals, in a project that carries special meaning for the self-confessed recovering Oxycontin addict. REUTERS/Adam Hunger/Files\nKennedy, 45, a Democrat and younger son of the late “Lion of the Senate” Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, is leading a group called Project SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana) that opposes legalization and seeks to rise above America’s culture war over pot with its images of long-haired hippies battling law-and-order conservatives.\nProject proposals include increased funding for mental health courts and treatment of drug dependency, so those caught using marijuana might avoid incarceration, get help and potentially have their criminal records cleared.\nKennedy wants cancer patients and others with serious illnesses to be able to obtain drugs with cannabinoids, but in a more regulated way that could involve the U.S. Food and Drug Administration playing a larger role.\nThe eight-term former congressman from Rhode Island and the group he chairs will put forth their plan on Wednesday with a media appearance in Denver.\nTheir efforts follow the November election that saw voters in Washington state and Colorado become the first in the nation to approve measures to tax and regulate pot sales for recreational use. Kennedy’s group is seeking to shift the debate and reclaim momentum for the anti-legalization movement, in part by proposing new solutions with appeal to liberals, such as taking a public health approach to combat marijuana use.\nLegalization backers have argued that the so-called War on Drugs launched in 1971 by former President Richard Nixon has failed to stem marijuana use, and has instead saddled otherwise law-abiding pot smokers with criminal records that may block their avenues to landing a successful job.\nKennedy faults the U.S. government for allocating too much of its $25 billion drug control budget to law enforcement rather than to treatment and prevention.\n“Yes, the drug war has been a failure, but let’s look at the science and let’s look at what works. And let’s not just throw out the baby with the bathwater,” Kennedy, who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2011, said in a telephone interview.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is still developing a policy in regard to the new state legalization measures.\nPresident Barack Obama said in an interview with ABC News last month that it did not make sense for the federal government to “focus on recreational drug users in a state that has already said that, under state law, that’s legal.”\nBIPARTISAN APPROACH\nConservative political commentator David Frum, a speech writer for former President George W. Bush, is also a board member on Project SAM, which lends it a bipartisan flavor.\nFor his part, Kennedy is aiming many of his arguments toward liberals like himself. Polls show Democrats largely favoring legalizing marijuana, and among the 18 states that allow medical marijuana, several are in the West and Northeast and are heavily Democratic.\n“The fact is people are afraid on the (political) left to look like they’re not for an alternative to incarceration and criminalization, and they’re afraid they’re not going to look sympathetic to a cancer patient” who might use marijuana, Kennedy said. As a result, he said the legalization position mistakenly comes to be seen as “glamorous.”\nKennedy admits to having smoked pot but also said that, as an asthma sufferer, he “found other ways to get high.”\nIn 2006, he crashed his car into a security barrier in Washington, D.C., and soon after sought treatment for drug dependency. He said he was addicted to the pain reliever Oxycontin at that time and suffered from alcoholism. He added that he has been continuously sober for nearly two years.\nKennedy, who was married for the first time in 2011, said he worries his 8-month-old son might be predisposed to drug abuse - due to a kind of genetic “trigger” - and that is part of his fight against legalization.\nHe also said he wants to “reduce the environmental factors that pull that trigger,” such as marijuana use being commonly accepted.\nMeanwhile, another prominent figure from Rhode Island, the newly crowned Miss Universe Olivia Culpo, is making waves by also objecting to legalization. She told Fox News this week there are “too many bad habits that go with the drug.”\nIn Washington state, Alison Holcomb was campaign director for the legalization measure, which billed itself as having a public health element to help people dependent on marijuana.\nThe measure, which is not set to go into full effect until after state regulators spend most of 2013 setting guidelines, would allow adults 21 and older to buy marijuana at special stores.\nHolcomb argued that drug dependency courts are more geared toward users of hardcore drugs, and that the approach her group put forward is the sensible one.\n“I don’t know what a public health approach without legalization looks like, if you’re still arresting people,” she said.\nTaxes on marijuana sales would generate, at the high end of estimates, over $500 million a year with $67 million of that going to a state agency that provides drug treatment, said Mark Cooke, policy adviser for the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington state, which supported the campaign.\nAlso included in the tax revenue would be $44 million for education and public health campaigns - including a phone line for people wanting to quit using marijuana, Cooke said.

Cristian, a 32-year-old blacksmith from Uruguay, grows five cannabis plants with care and dedication in the back yard of his workshop on the outskirts of Montevideo.\n"I have been smoking three or four joints a day since I was 13," he says.\n"But last year I decided to grow my own cannabis because the quality of the marijuana at the boca (hotspots where illegal drugs are sold) is too low, or it comes mixed with hard and dangerous drugs, like cocaine paste," he says.\nEvery morning Cristian checks his plants have the appropriate amount of light, fertiliser and insecticide.\nBut above all, he always makes sure they are well hidden from the police and out of the neighbours\' sight.\nState control\nFor decades, smoking cannabis has been legal in this South American country.\nSeeing a group of youngsters sharing a joint in the park has become a familiar scene, but growing and buying the drug have remained illegal.\nBut that is about to change.\nUruguay is set to become the first nation in the world to regulate the production, sale and consumption of cannabis after a new law was passed by the country\'s senate on Tuesday.\nOnce the president signs the bill, the state will control the production and sale of cannabis.\nFor Cristian, this will mean that instead of hiding his plants from the police, the authorities will supervise them to make sure he complies with the new rules.\nA central body, the National Institute for Cannabis Regulation, will provide those who want to grow marijuana with seeds and ensure that their crop does not exceed the legal limit of 480g (1lb 1oz) per year.\nCristian welcomes the change.\n"I think it was about time that cannabis became legal. Police should worry about fighting crime and drug trafficking, not me," he says.\n\'No weed-for-all\'\nThis law does not solve the real problemsVeronica Alonso, Congresswoman, National Party\nThe man behind the law is 78-year-old former guerrilla fighter turned President Jose Mujica.\nThe president says he opposes drug consumption but wants to take the multi-million-dollar cannabis business away from the drug cartels.\n"This won\'t be a weed-for-all country," Mr Mujica assured critics.\nUnder the new law, buyers will have to officially register - something only residents can do, not tourists.\nThere will also be a strict 40g/month limit on those who grow the drug or buy it at licensed pharmacies.\n"What I am doing is offering consumers a legal amount," President Mujica explains.\nGlobal first\nThe bill goes several steps further than existing legislation in the Netherlands, where growing cannabis is not legal, although the authorities turn a blind eye to those who grow some plants at home.\nIt bears some similarities to drug laws in the US states of Colorado and Washington, where the sale of cannabis for medicinal or recreational use was made legal in 2012.\nBut Uruguay is the first nation state to regulate the production, distribution and sale of the drug.\nThe country, which has a population of fewer than 3.5 million people, has so far been spared much of the drug-related violence that other Latin American countries have suffered from, but officials say it is time to tackle drug gangs before they get too strong.\n"Last year, 82 people were killed in drug-related violence in Uruguay. We are starting to see episodes of criminal score-settling, groups of hitmen ... but we are not aware of anybody who died because of marijuana consumption," explains the head of the National Drug Agency, Julio Calzada.\n\'Visionary\'\nOther Latin American countries are watching Uruguay\'s experiment with interest.\nGuatemalan President Otto Perez Molina, whose country is suffering from a wave of violence blamed on drug cartels, has described his Uruguayan counterpart as "a visionary".\nOthers view Mr Mujica\'s experiment with scepticism.\nMexican Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade recently warned that "unilateral policies" would not solve the problem, and asked for a global discussion about drug policy.\nUruguay\'s neighbour Brazil sent a delegation to Montevideo earlier this year to express its concern about the potential impact of the new law.\nBut Mr Calzada insists Uruguay\'s neighbours will benefit as well as its own citizens.\n"Our commitment to other countries is that our legal marijuana will not end up smuggled into their territory. This will not happen," he assures foreign sceptics.\nOpposition\nBut the law is also facing criticism at home. According to recent polls, 60% of Uruguayans oppose the bill.\nCongresswoman Veronica Alonso of the National Party is one of them.\n"This law does not solve the real problems. If the government really wants to fight insecurity it should tackle the places where illegal drugs are sold," she told the BBC.\n"If it is a matter of public health, then it should work to prevent the consumption of other drugs, like tobacco or alcohol," she argues.\nMs Alonso fears that the law will encourage drug consumption, especially among young Uruguayans.\n"There will be a higher availability of marijuana and at the same time the perception of marijuana as a dangerous drug will be lower. Therefore consumption will grow," she says.\n"This is going to cause us a lot of problems, especially from a social and medical point of view, and the State is not ready to face them."\nWhether good or bad, the effects of the government\'s pioneering move are certain to be scrutinised and analysed by both opponents and supporters of cannabis legalisation not just in Uruguay but across the world.

More\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Outside the view of paying customers, people accused of shoplifting at Macy\'s huge flagship store are escorted by security guards to cells in "Room 140," where they can be held for hours, asked to sign an admission of guilt and pay hundreds in fines, sometimes without any conclusive proof they stole anything.\nAs shoppers jam stores ahead of the December holidays, claims of racial profiling at department stores in New York have helped expose the wide latitude that laws in at least 27 states give retailers to hold and fine shoplifting suspects, even if a person hasn\'t yet technically stolen anything, is wrongly accused or criminal charges are dropped.\n"You must remember, these people are not police officers; they are store employees," said Faruk Usar, the attorney for a 62-year-old Turkish woman who sued Macy\'s, which some customers say bullied them into paying fines on the spot or harassed them with letters demanding payment. "When they are detained, they are not yet even in a real jail."\nIndustrywide, more than $12 billion is lost to shoplifting each year. The laws, which vary on strictness and fine amounts, allow stores to try to recoup some losses. Under New York\'s longstanding law, retailers may collect a penalty of five times the cost of the stolen merchandise, up to $500 per item, plus as much as $1,500 if the merchandise isn\'t in a condition to be sold. A conviction is not necessary to bring a civil claim.\nSome customers say stores have harassed them into signing admissions of guilt in order to turn a profit — not just recoup a loss.\nRetailers don\'t divulge how much money they recoup but use it in part to offset security costs, said Barbara Staib, spokeswoman for the National Association for Shoplifting Prevention. The total is a fraction of what they lose, she said.\n"We tend to forget that retailers are the victims of crime when it comes to shoplifting," she said.\nBut at least nine customers at the Macy\'s store immortalized in "Miracle on 34th Street" say in lawsuits that the retailer is abusing the law, wrongly targeting minorities and holding customers for hours, years after it settled similar claims brought by the state attorney general by paying a $600,000 fine and changing practices. That agreement expired in 2008.

USA TODAY\n1.3 million jobless workers could lose benefits by Jan. 1 and 850%2C000 more by March 31\nSome struggling households already hit by food stamp cuts\nEmergency benefits%27 expiration would detract from growth elsewhere in economy\nAbout 1.3 million unemployed Americans are set to lose their extended jobless benefits by the end of December if Congress doesn\'t renew the program, delivering another blow to struggling households hit with recent cuts in food stamps.\nAnother 850,000 people would run out of unemployment insurance from January through March when their roughly 26 weeks of state benefits end, according to the National Employment Law Project.\n"There\'s a view … that it would be too heavy a blow both to the economy and to struggling unemployed families to have both food stamp benefits and unemployment benefits all (be cut) within two months of each other," says Bob Greenstein, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nOn Nov. 1, a temporary increase in food stamp benefits was phased out, affecting more than 47 million Americans.\nSome of those affected also receive jobless benefits, NELP says, though it had no specific data.\nIn 2008, in the middle of the recession, the federal government began providing up to a year or more of "emergency" unemployment benefits to supplement the typical 26 weeks of coverage that states provide.\nIn January, Congress renewed that program as part of the "fiscal cliff" deal on tax increases and spending cuts, but scaled it back. This year, the unemployed have received 14 to 47 weeks of emergency benefits, depending on their state\'s jobless rate, NELP figures show.\nThose benefits are slated to end Dec. 28, abruptly cutting off payments to the 1.3 million people already receiving them and ensuring that another 850,000 will get no more checks when their 26 weeks of state benefits expire between January and March.\nBy some measures, the labor market has improved, with unemployment falling to 7.3% last month from a peak of 10% in October 2009. But long-term unemployment has come down only modestly, with 4.1 million Americans, or 36% of all the unemployed, out of work at least six months. They would be the most affected by a phaseout of emergency benefits.\n"There\'s still a crisis of long-term unemployment," says NELP program director Maurice Emsellem.\nThe portion of the long-term unemployed receiving benefits has fallen to 34% from 45% a year ago, and would drop to 25% if the emergency program is shut down, NELP says.\nThe move also would reduce economic growth next year by 0.15 percentage points, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\'s Analytics. Each dollar the government pays out in benefits yields $1.42 in economic output because the unemployed tend to spend nearly all their payments, he says.\nThe economy has grown at a relatively weak annual rate of 2.1% in the first three quarters of this year.\nZandi says renewing the extended benefits program is somewhat less likely this year because there\'s no directly relevant bill, such as the fiscal cliff package, to which the measure could be attached.\nGreenstein says it could be added to anticipated budget or Medicare legislation. The White House recently urged Congress to extend the program and last week Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee called for a hearing on the issue.\nCandace Stewart, 58, says she would have to sell her townhouse if she lost her emergency benefits of about $400 week. Stewart, who was laid off from her job as a quality control inspector last April, has sent out nearly 200 résumés but gotten just two interviews.\n"There\'s just nothing out there to get," she says.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder cleared the way for a state takeover of Detroit, declaring that the birthplace of the U.S. automotive industry faces a fiscal emergency and that he has identified a top candidate to assume its management.\nFriday’s declaration by the Republican governor virtually assures that the state of Michigan will assume control of Detroit’s books, and eventually decide whether the city should file the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.\nDetroit has faced the steepest population decline of any major American city in recent decades. Once the fifth largest U.S. city and springboard for music icons such as Michael Jackson and Diana Ross, it now ranks 18th in size with about 700,000 people.\n“Its time to say we should stop going downhill,” Snyder told a forum of residents hand-picked by his office, at a Detroit public television station. “There have been many good people who have had many plans, many attempts to turn this around. They haven’t worked,” he said.\nA report commissioned by Snyder has described what it called “operational dysfunction” in the city government, crushing debt of $14 billion and a current fiscal year budget deficit of $100 million.\nDetroit Mayor Dave Bing did not attend the announcement, nor did city council members appear to be in the audience. Earlier on Friday, a majority of the council said they wanted to challenge Snyder’s decision but did not decide how to proceed.\nWhile Snyder made his announcement on Wayne State University’s campus, a few dozen protesters gathered about two miles away at city hall, clutching signs that read “Snyder, Go Home!” and “This is a takeover!”\nThe fate of Detroit is being watched closely across the country as many cities and towns are still struggling to recover from the housing bust and the deep recession that followed.\nTOP CANDIDATE\nSnyder would not identify the top candidate to run Detroit or say whether the person was from Michigan. Some residents and restructuring experts have said he should name an African-American to manage the city, which is 83 percent black.\nReferring to the candidate, the Republican governor said, “They have vast experience working on relationships, they have strong financial knowledge, strong legal knowledge and that ability to say how do we build teams and work together,” the Republican governor said of the candidate.\nSnyder had acknowledged last week that many qualified people did not want the controversial job.\nThe emergency manager will eventually have strong powers to develop a financial plan, revise or reject city budgets, consolidate departments, reduce or eliminate the salaries of elected officials, sell eligible assets, lay off workers and renegotiate labor contracts.\nReaction in the city ranged from anger to despair and resignation.\nMayor Bing, a former professional basketball player and steel executive, said he did not favor an emergency manager but would try to work with the state of Michigan.\n“If, in fact, the appointment of an Emergency Financial Manager both stabilizes the City fiscally and supports our restructuring initiatives which improve the quality of life for our citizens, then I think there is a way for us to work together,” he said in a statement.\nBing has complained that part of Detroit’s financial crisis stems from cuts in state funds for the city.\nKaren Lewis, 49, a manager at a fast food store, reflected the resentment some residents feel at the takeover of the predominantly black and Democratic city by a predominantly white and Republican state government.\n“It don’t take a genius to know what this is all about,” said Lewis, who is black. “They want our money and our land. No one cares about us. And we’re the ones who stuck around. Not the white folks.”\nBut Bernard Ragin, 41, said he was tired of living in a city that has seen a collapse of basic services.\n“I don’t care who fixes Detroit, as long as the street lights work and the police show up on time,” he said.\nDetroit officials now have 10 days to request a hearing with the governor about his decision. Snyder said the hearing would be held on March 12. The nine-member city council has been preparing to argue that Detroit should not have an emergency manager and could also appeal the decision in state court.\nAfter the hearing, Snyder will either confirm or revoke the declaration of emergency. If he confirms the emergency, as expected, management of Detroit’s fiscal affairs would revert to a board composed of three state officials who will be Snyder appointees. The board would formally appoint an emergency manager, although in practice Snyder will make the final decision.\nMichigan Democratic Party Chairman Lon Johnson sharply criticized Snyder’s decision, calling it a “hostile take-over.”\n“This overthrow of the democratic process is a deeply disappointing moment in our state’s history,” Johnson said.\nAl Garrett, president of Detroit’s biggest union representing municipal employees, said efforts are underway to challenge the decision in court. But he said the case would have to be filed in federal court rather than state court because the Michigan Supreme Court has a Republican majority.\nA court challenge of Snyder’s decision would not delay the appointment of a manager, a state government official said.\nSnyder said that Detroit’s creditors should be brought to the table to renegotiate debt terms by possibly delaying or relieving payments.\n“This should be part of the strategy that needs to take place,” he said.

* White House proposed biggest food-aid change since Cold War\n* Little support among lawmakers for administration package\n* No more food-aid reform expected in Senate farm bill\nBy Charles Abbott\nWASHINGTON, June 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted on Monday to make only a minor change in the main U.S. global food aid program, rebuffing President Barack Obama’s call for the biggest reform of the hunger relief program since the Cold War.\nSenators agreed in a voice vote to allocate only $60 million a year for the purchase of food aid under the Food for Peace program in or near the country for which it is destined.\nThis was an increase of only $20 million in a program that spends roughly $1.4 billion a year to purchase and ship American-grown food thousands of miles to hunger spots.\n“It would modestly increase the authorization for local and regional purchase,” Agriculture Committee chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, said in a debate that lasted less than two minutes.\nNo other food-aid reform amendments are expected to be offered in the U.S. farm bill currently under debate.\nThe United States is the world’s largest food aid donor. The administration proposed in April that up to 45 percent of funding for the Food for Peace program should be available for use as food vouchers or to buy food locally, saying this would allow up to 10 percent more people to be helped at lower cost.\nA pilot program in the 2008 farm law showed local purchase can speed delivery of food aid, according to a Cornell University study. It also said local purchases could halve the cost of grain, although processed foods sometimes cost more locally.\nThe international development group Oxfam said the additional $20 million was a small step to “bring our food aid programs into the 21st century,” but that greater reform was desperately needed.\nFood aid groups are split on local purchase. Oxfam, CARE, Save the Children and American Jewish World Service support it, while opponents include World Vision, Planet Aid and International Relief and Development.\nIt is also opposed by farm-state lawmakers, maritime groups and food processors. A Senate staff worker said there were also doubts among lawmakers as to whether the State Department can handle the chore of large-scale food purchases overseas.\nFood for Peace has operated solely on donation of American food ever since it was created in 1954 and by law, at least half the aid must travel on U.S.-flagged vessels.\nUnder the White House plan, funding would be diverted to State Department accounts for disaster relief, local food projects and emergency food aid.\nEthiopia, Sudan, Kenya and Pakistan were among the largest recipients of U.S. food aid last year. Such aid typically includes rice, vegetable oil, lentils, dry beans, a corn-soy blend, bulgur and dried peas. (Reporting by Charles Abbott, editing by Ros Krasny and David Brunnstrom)

Bill Maher’s New Rules on the plea to raise the minimum wage is on point. It is hard to understand anyone’s objection to it. A country cannot frown on citizen’s using public assistance if it does not create an economy that pays a living wage to all its citizens that are working.\nThe following snippet with the most relevant bullets from his New Rules segment on the minimum wage is on point.\nBill Maher’s New Rules Snippet On The Minimum Wage\nWhen it comes to raising the minimum wage Conservatives always say it is a non-starter because it cuts into profits. … You might think that paying people enough to live is so self-evident that even crazy people could understand it. But you would be wrong. …\nMichele Bachmann is not only against raising the minimum wage, she is against having one at all. She wants said “… if we took away the minimum wage … we could … virtually wipe out unemployment … because we would be able to offer jobs at whatever level.” …\nAnd naturally Ted Cruz agrees. Ted Cruz thinks it’s a good thing that when his Cuban father came to America he was paid fifty cents an hour to work as a dishwasher. …\nWhen did the American dream become this pathway to indentured servitude, this economic death spiral where workers get paid next to nothing, so they can only afford to buy next to nothing, so businesses are forced to sell cheaper and cheaper shit?\nConsider the fact that most fast food workers whose average age by the way is 29 … are on some form of public assistance which is not surprising. When even working people can’t make enough to live they take money from the government.\nThis is the question the Right has to answer. Do you want smaller government with less handouts or do you want do you want a low minimum wage because you cannot have both. If Coronel Sanders isn’t going to pay the lady behind the counter enough to live on, then Uncle Sam has to. And I for one is getting a little tired of helping highly profitable companies pay their workers.\nBill Maher makes a very important statement. The average American citizens are subsidizing McDonald’s. Americans are subsidizing all companies that are paying below subsistence level wages.\nThe viral story of a McDonald’s employee calling a McDonald’s help line is probative. McDonald’s gave her information necessary to get government assistance and charity. This was a full time worker. What she really needs is an increase in the minimum wage. What she needs is the dignity of pay she can live on.\nBill Maher is late to the party. George Carlin figured out long time ago that the American Dream had become a pathway to indentured servitude. He laid it out in his “The American Dream” standup skit. The minimum wage is part of the problem. However, the problem of the poor and working middle class is much deeper.\nThe problem is income and wealth disparity that is getting worse. Income and growth is extracted from the poor and the middle class with policies to ensure the incessant steady growth of the wealth and income of a very few.

(Reuters) - Michigan’s Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican, said on Saturday he would defend retirees who risk losing public pensions because of Detroit’s bankruptcy, putting him at odds with the city’s emergency manager appointed by fellow Republican Governor Rick Snyder.\nSchuette, an elected official, said the Michigan state constitution is “crystal clear” in stating that pension plans are a contractual obligation that may not be diminished or impaired.\n“Retirees may face a potential financial crisis not of their own making, possibly a result of pension fund mismanagement,” Schuette said in a statement.\nThe attorney general said he would file in federal bankruptcy court on Monday on behalf of the pensioners affected by the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history.\nA U.S. bankruptcy court judge on Wednesday dealt a blow to Detroit’s public employee unions and pension funds opposed to the filing by suspending legal challenges in Michigan state courts while he reviews the city’s petition for protection from creditors.\nThe city’s unions and pension funds had hoped to keep the fight in state court, where they felt Michigan’s constitutional protections of retiree benefits would prevail against any efforts by state-appointed Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr to scale them back.\nJudge Steven Rhodes ordered three lawsuits filed by city workers, retirees and pension funds halted and said that applied also to suits against Orr as well as Michigan’s governor and treasurer.\nIn a June 14 proposal to creditors, Orr called for “significant cuts in accrued, vested pension amounts for both active and currently retired persons.”\nA spokesman for Orr said on Saturday the bankruptcy court would have the final say on the pension issue.\n“The emergency manager plans to establish the city’s eligibility to file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection and then move as swiftly as possible to propose a plan of adjustment that will help create a strong and viable Detroit and will enable the city to provide essential public services to its 700,000 residents,” Orr spokesman Bill Nowling said in an emailed statement.\nDetroit, a former manufacturing powerhouse and cradle of the U.S. automotive industry, filed for bankruptcy protection on July 18.\nThe city has struggled for decades with companies moving or closing, rampant crime, shrinking population and political corruption. The city’s revenue failed to keep pace with spending, leading to years of budget deficits and a dependence on borrowing to stay afloat.\nDetroit has more than $18 billion of debt and unfunded liabilities. That includes $5.7 billion in liabilities for healthcare and other retiree benefits and a $3.5 billion pension liability.\nThe word 'Bankruptcy' is seen painted on the side of a vacant building by street artists as a statement on the financial affairs of the city on Grand River Avenue in Detroit, Michigan July 26, 2013. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook\nSchuette said he would continue to represent governor Snyder and state agencies in legal proceedings related to the bankruptcy, even though he is taking a different view on the pension issue.\nIn an emailed statement, Snyder’s press secretary Sara Wurfel said the governor’s office expects that Schuette will “vigorously defend” its efforts as well.\n“Our response is that this is an important issue, and we appreciate and support efforts to get clarity and help determine the best path moving forward that respects and is fair to pensioners and all parties,” Wurfel said.

President Barack Obama took us inside his mind, again, Tuesday night and gave us a glimpse of what motivates him, how he sees the country and how much of the country sees itself.\nThe president is psychologically predictable. He does not surprise. Having been abandoned as a boy by his father, and then his mother, only to then learn that his grandmother feared people of his race, he seems inherently to distrust individual initiative and intention and to place his trust only in the collective—i.e. the state. What benefits a burgeoning central authority is good for all. When a child’s guardians keep letting him down in profound ways, that child can grow up to want a lot of power himself and distrust the idea of giving anyone else very much.\nHence, the president wants to use tax increases to remove wealth from those who earned it, fair and square. Because, you see, wealth really does confer power on those who amass it, and giving that kind of authority to individuals, rather than the collective, is anathema to the President. It likely reawakens in him very closely held memories of what he got from his parents when most in need: Not much.\nIndividuals are also better off without guns, the president would have us believe. It is true, of course, that some capital crimes are committed with guns (but only the minority with automatic weapons, and lots with knives and explosives and by strangulation, too).\n[pullquote]\nBut guns also happen to empower tens of millions of American individuals, too. They promote in individuals the idea that they can take care of themselves and make their own decisions and take care of their families, including their children. And that’s what I believe is the president’s real problem with them. Because, as a boy, the independent decisions of the adults around him were, frankly, horribly traumatizing.\nThe president celebrates his Affordable Care Act. But the reality of ObamaCare is that, for the first time, ever, it earmarks American citizens’ after-tax income to be spent, by law, on a product that they might or might not want: health insurance. They have to buy it. The collective always knows best in Obama’s mind. Because individuals left him out in the cold, when he needed consistency and nurturance the most.\nMany millions of young Americans listened to Barack Obama on Tuesday night, as they have listened to his core message for nearly five long years. And his message has remained remarkably consistent and remarkably toxic to their psychological well-being: Do not rely on yourself. Entitlement Nation will parent you, until you forget about growing up, period. Stay on your parents’ health insurance, even if you are 18 and in great health and would rather—wisely or not—use that money to start an Internet company in your basement. It’s okay to blame rich people if you can’t earn money. Just ignore the fact that government policy is now hostile to entrepreneurs who might otherwise decide it is worth the risk to staff up.\nThe government will even grade colleges and tell you which ones are worth attending. Really? Teenagers can’t even research that for themselves, anymore? Their parents can’t help them evaluate schools? The state, the collective—long known for the miserable educational system it has deployed—will decide which institutions of higher learning are worthy?\nWelcome to the psychological projection of an abandoned boy’s vision of how much you can rely on other individuals and on yourself. The less, the better. When your mother and father take off on you as a kid, when your white grandmother seems to fear people of color, you probably figure putting any trust in individuals is crazy.\nMy 10-year-old son was watching last night. I was just glad that he got to see part of the Bruins’ game, too. Because he saw remarkable athletes find something inside themselves that they tapped to come back from being down three goals, to tie the game 3-3 (even though they eventually lost in a shootout). And when Brad Marchand scored that tying goal, with 42 seconds left, and no goalie in the Bruins’ net, I saw my son jump up, out of his chair and pump his fist in the air and yell, “Yes! He did it! He did it!”\n“Yup,” I said, “He’s amazing.”\nPeople—individual people—make things happen. Yes, they are part of a team. But celebrating their individual accomplishments and rewarding them for them isn’t bad. It’s good. Brad Marchand scored that goal. He did it. And people build their own businesses, too, Mr. President. Things did not go well for you at the hands of the individuals who were empowered to care for you. But individuals are not inherently bad.

Governor Jan Brewer (R/Teahadi-AZ) is getting a lot of really good press right now for having pushed Medicaid expansion through the more-or-less Tea Party controlled Arizona legislature. Admittedly, this is, in and of itself, an unabashedly good thing. Hundreds of thousands of Arizonans, the poorest and most at-risk among us, will no longer be without care. The safety net Arizona voted to give ourselves, AHCCCS, has been restored in a way that will improve our economy and shore up our state\'s still shaky finances. Regardless the motive, the outcome is a great thing.\nThat said, you can take this media redemption of Jan Brewer and stuff it. Chris Hayes, I\'m looking at you.\nLet\'s be clear, Jan Brewer is not an idiot. She may have been the rising star and darling of the far right of the Arizona Republican Party, but she\'s not a Black Helicopter Republican. Consider the gold coin bill. This pile of arble-garble had two reasons behind it. There was the reason that the national press got - the need to give opportunities to gold savers to spend their gold (which defeats the purposes of gold saving). Then there was the actual reason that circulated on the ground. OBAMA was going to spend so much money that the dollar was just going to continue inflating so much it would be useless, and Arizona needed to be prepared! Prepared, I say!!\nNevermind that the facts dictate that neither inflation nor federal spending have exactly been rocketing into the sun, they know.\nThe Black Helicopter Caucus has given us the Agenda 21 ban, forced oaths of loyalty, a pee bill (not joking, and neither were they), and defended your right to hate. Granted, this has provided Arizona with some excellent political entertainment. But walk through the Governor\'s signatures of these bills. The Agenda 21 ban? Signed. Pee bill? Killed in the House (due to global outrage turning it completely toxic, thanks everybody). The gold coin bill? Vetoed for technical reasons. But what Jan Brewer cares about is Jan Brewer. That lovely religious anarchy bill? She wrote in a letter that she regretted vetoing it, but she shot that hostage (and four more) dead to get AHCCCS expansion.\nNow, to someone who has lived here for years, I feel the need to inform all of you who have not of a simple truth. Arizona is not normal. I do not mean "weird" the way most out of state folk mean it. I do not mean crazy. I mean there\'s the way the rest of the South runs, then there\'s how the South runs, and then there\'s Arizona. Arizonans like the political theater. We\'re the state that produced both Sinema and McCain, both Brewer and Grijalva. We expect them to be colorful, energetic, full of ideas and brilliant speeches, and if they are anything less, we tend to just stay home and let the other guy win.\nNow, in terms of colorful, Jan Brewer is a damn rainbow. The electoral issue for her is to whom her colors appeal. Arizona\'s demographics are shifting at a breathtaking pace. The state is rapidly turning younger and browner, the electorate is moving steadily leftward on high-visibility issues. Now, were Jan Brewer running for governor again, she\'d\'ve taken the Medicaid money and not moved on immigratiion. But Brewer can\'t run for Governor, she\'s term limited. She can, however, run for McCain\'s seat in 2016.\nConsider McCain\'s behavior. He\'s back to work on his legacy issue - immigration. On immigration, he reality checked his own party. On drones he all but body checked Rand Paul. He\'s monkeying in Syria, rumored to be scuttling Russian-American talks on the subject. McCain is spending political capital like a sailor spends cash, which only makes sense for one reason: he\'s getting done. McCain will be 80 when his term ends. Generic old at this age usually raises the r-word, but lest we forget, the man valiantly served his country under what can only be described as the most harrowing of circumstances, and carries the physical scars that go with it. I may not always agree with his politics, but he\'s generally proved himself to be an upright man whose convictions are real. He\'s earned the right to shore up his reputation, settle some old scores, and live out his days in well-earned peace on his Cornville ranch. That said, in my opinion, all signs point to Brewer burnishing her legacy in the hopes that in 2016 she\'ll be remembered more for Medicaid expansion than for SB1070, for denying DREAMers their licenses, for selling the Capitol, and on and on the list goes. The reason is simple - she is gambling that by the 2016 Senate race, if she can run as the Governor that worked across the aisle, she can force the Democrat to run negative against her, and Democrats do not win when we run negative.\nThere\'s only one catch. This strategy relies on collective amnesia. We would do well to let that stop being a feature of the American electorate. She\'s no less extreme and calculating a politician after Medicaid than before it, and the media, especially the liberal media, should remember all of her tenure, from 2009 to 2014, not from January til now. So America, do Arizona a favor - stop white-washing Jan Brewer. She doesn\'t deserve it.

In the public relations push for his takeover of the American health care system, President Obama promised that those who like their insurance could keep it, premiums would decrease, and no one would lose their doctor. We know now those were all lies told repeatedly and never questioned by a media that is still looking the other way. Another promise Obama made was that ObamaCare would not fund abortions. LifeNews reports that this was also a lie:\nThe ObamaCare statute specifically requires the issuers of Exchange plans that cover abortion to “collect from each enrollee in the plan” a “separate payment” for the type of abortions for which funding is prohibited under the Hyde Amendment (which is all abortions other than in cases of life of the mother, rape, or incest) and a separate payment for all other services. [42 U.S.C. 18023(b)]. These separate payments are then to be deposited into separate accounts.\nDuring the regulatory process, commenters questioned HHS on how this was to be implemented, and according to HHS, the commenters “recommended that HHS clarify . . . whether [Exchange plan] issuers may satisfy the separate payment provision by providing each enrollee with an itemized bill, and whether an enrollee’s coverage would be terminated for failure to comply with the separate payment provision.” Rather than doing so, HHS merely said that the comments would be taken into consideration in any future guidance. [77 Fed. Reg. 18430 (March 27, 2012)].\nNow, despite the clear language of the ObamaCare statute, it appears that the separate check requirement is not going to be enforced by the Obama Administration. Gretchen Borchelt, director of state reproductive health policy at the National Women’s Law Center, told the Huffington Post that “we used to talk about it as being two checks that the consumer would have to write because of the segregation requirements, but that’s not the way it’s being implemented.” (Huffington Post, Sept. 3, 2013).\nLikewise, a spokeswoman for Rhode Island’s Exchange told PolitiFact Rhode Island that “the customer is not billed a separate fee.” (Politifact, Oct. 2, 2013. The Rhode Island Exchange will handle the billing, not the plan issuers). As PolitiFact notes, “it turns out to be a hidden fee.”\nThere is nothing the media is willing to make Obama pay a political price for. Not even repeatedly lying to millions who are about to lose their insurance or forcing people to violate their conscience over the abomination of abortion.

Obama&rsquo;s defenders, meanwhile, argued that some 2013 setbacks should be placed in context.

But broader issues outside of Obama&rsquo;s control were more determinative.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The fact is you start out wanting to talk about and work on one set of issues and then events drag you to other places,&rdquo; Axelrod said, pointing to the Newtown shootings and Syrian civil war as examples. &ldquo;That is really the story of this year. ... A lot of it has to do with random events and orchestrated subversion on the part of the opposition.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Certainly, there were moments during the year when the president was forced off of his agenda.

That&rsquo;s led to an administration too comfortable with conventional wisdom. The president didn&rsquo;t challenge the intelligence community over the surveillance programs, and he made back room deals that complicated the health care law unnecessarily.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s ironic, others said, is that Obama is more comfortable as president now than at any point since he was elected. Drew Westen, a professor at Emory University, famously criticized Obama in 2011 on the <a data-rapid-parsed="slk" data-rapid_p="6" data-v9y="0" data-ylk="subsec:paragraph;cpos:21;elm:context_link;itc:0" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/opinion/sunday/what-happened-to-obamas-passion.html?pagewanted=all">op-ed pages of The New York Times</a> for acquiescing too much to his opponents and for uninspiring oratory.</p>\n<p>Today, Westen praises Obama for increasingly relying on executive actions. If he were to grade Obama, he said he&rsquo;d give him higher marks than &ldquo;in all his prior years.&rdquo; Where Obama&rsquo;s administration has been tripped up, he argued, has been in a failure to elevate issues and messages that matter.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There were people like me who at the end of 2009 were saying, &lsquo;You have got to start messaging in a coherent way about not only health care, but about what you are going to do about jobs and reigning in the power of banks, protecting consumers against predatory lending and credit practices that the average person was furious about,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Westen &ldquo;That stuff was all clearly predictable by the end of 2009. Where I would fault him now is that I think he is doing the same thing again before this midterm election.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>A request for comment from the White House was not returned. But it seems clear already that Obama and his team see value in Westen&rsquo;s point. In recent weeks, the administration has begun focusing on income inequality, wage stagnation and the need to spur job growth. Aides stressed that one of the first orders of business in 2014 will be getting unemployment insurance renewed.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The core issue of the 2012 campaign was strengthening economic security for the middle class,&rdquo; said one former White House official. &ldquo;The question is whether putting every other issue on the back burner and focusing on that out of the gate would have changed the outcomes. My answer: maybe not significantly, but somewhat.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And then there is the Occam&rsquo;s razor view of what went wrong. Had the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s rollout not been so badly botched, the year-end retrospective would have been kinder.</p>\n<p>Howard Dean, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and Vermont governor, argued as much when asked for his assessment. Every president who wins a second term suffers setbacks during his fifth year in office, Dean noted. And in all cases, the problems confronting Obama had to do either with a policy that he pushed or a personal decision that he made.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a policy issue, it was a digital problem,&rdquo; Dean said. &ldquo;He is in trouble because of the website.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>And for that reason, there is hope for a bounce in 2014.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I would argue that if he didn&rsquo;t have the website collapse, he wouldn&rsquo;t be subjected to the five-year curse as much,&rdquo; said Dean. &ldquo;All the other five-year curses were of the sitting president&rsquo;s own making. This one you may argue that three people down the line screwed up the website, not Obama. ... I do not think that he has been personally stained the way the other presidents were.&rdquo;</p>', 'text': 'WASHINGTON — The end of the year brings with it one of journalism’s lazier crutches — the annual list of winners and losers.\nWhatever value there is in judging a politician’s standings in late December, it’s limited.

Drew Westen, a professor at Emory University, famously criticized Obama in 2011 on the op-ed pages of The New York Times for acquiescing too much to his opponents and for uninspiring oratory.\nToday, Westen praises Obama for increasingly relying on executive actions. If he were to grade Obama, he said he’d give him higher marks than “in all his prior years.” Where Obama’s administration has been tripped up, he argued, has been in a failure to elevate issues and messages that matter.\n“There were people like me who at the end of 2009 were saying, ‘You have got to start messaging in a coherent way about not only health care, but about what you are going to do about jobs and reigning in the power of banks, protecting consumers against predatory lending and credit practices that the average person was furious about,’” said Westen “That stuff was all clearly predictable by the end of 2009. Where I would fault him now is that I think he is doing the same thing again before this midterm election.”\nA request for comment from the White House was not returned. But it seems clear already that Obama and his team see value in Westen’s point. In recent weeks, the administration has begun focusing on income inequality, wage stagnation and the need to spur job growth. Aides stressed that one of the first orders of business in 2014 will be getting unemployment insurance renewed.\n“The core issue of the 2012 campaign was strengthening economic security for the middle class,” said one former White House official. “The question is whether putting every other issue on the back burner and focusing on that out of the gate would have changed the outcomes. My answer: maybe not significantly, but somewhat.”\nAnd then there is the Occam’s razor view of what went wrong. Had the Affordable Care Act’s rollout not been so badly botched, the year-end retrospective would have been kinder.\nHoward Dean, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and Vermont governor, argued as much when asked for his assessment. Every president who wins a second term suffers setbacks during his fifth year in office, Dean noted. And in all cases, the problems confronting Obama had to do either with a policy that he pushed or a personal decision that he made.\n“It wasn’t a policy issue, it was a digital problem,” Dean said. “He is in trouble because of the website.”\nAnd for that reason, there is hope for a bounce in 2014.\n“I would argue that if he didn’t have the website collapse, he wouldn’t be subjected to the five-year curse as much,” said Dean. “All the other five-year curses were of the sitting president’s own making. This one you may argue that three people down the line screwed up the website, not Obama. ... I do not think that he has been personally stained the way the other presidents were.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Fast-food workers and labor organizers are marching, waving signs and chanting in cities across the country Thursday amid a push for higher wages.\nOrganizers say walkouts are planned in 100 cities, with rallies set for another 100 cities. But it\'s not clear what the actual turnout will be, how many of the participants are workers and what impact they\'ll have on restaurant operations.\nThe actions would mark the largest showing yet in a push that began a year ago. At a time when there\'s growing national and international attention on economic disparities, labor unions, worker advocacy groups and Democrats are hoping to build public support to raise the federal minimum wage of $7.25, or about $15,000 a year for full-time work.\nProtesters are calling for pay of $15 an hour, but the figure is seen more as a rallying point than a near-term possibility.\nIn New York City, about 100 protesters blew whistles and beat drums while marching into a McDonald\'s at around 6:30 a.m.; one startled customer grabbed his food and fled as they flooded the restaurant, while another didn\'t look up from eating and reading amid their chants of "We can\'t survive on $7.25!"\nCommunity leaders took turns giving speeches for about 15 minutes until the police arrived and ordered protesters out of the store. The crowd continued to demonstrate outside for about 45 minutes. A McDonald\'s manager declined to be interviewed and asked that the handful of customers in the store not be bothered.\nIn Detroit, about 50 demonstrators turned out for a pre-dawn rally in front of a McDonald\'s. A handful of employees walked off the job, but the restaurant stayed open as a manager and other employees worked the front counter and drive-thru window.\nJulius Waters, a 29-year-old McDonald\'s maintenance worker who was among the protesters, said it\'s hard making ends meet on his wage of $7.40 an hour.\n"I need a better wage for myself, because, right now, I\'m relying on aid, and $7.40 is not able to help me maintain taking care of my son. I\'m a single parent," Waters said.

USA TODAY\nPresident Obama said Friday he likes the proposed congressional budget deal, but Congress should also extend soon-to-expire unemployment insurance.\n"You\'ve potentially 1.3 million people who, during Christmastime, are going to lose their unemployment benefits, at a time when it\'s still very difficult for a lot of folks to find a job," Obama said before meeting with a group of newly elected mayors from across the country.\n"That\'s not just bad for those individuals and for those families, that\'s bad for our economy and that\'s bad for our cities," Obama said.\nThe House approved a two-year budget agreement on Thursday, and the Senate is expected to vote next week.\nThe two-year plan would avoid "the constant brinksmanship and crisis governance that we\'ve seen up on Capitol Hill that impedes growth and makes businesses and investors less certain about wanting to put their money in," Obama said.\nThe budget, he said, is something the federal government can do to help mayors create jobs, the topic of Obama\'s meeting with the mayors.\nThe president also again advocated an increase in the minimum wage, saying "that could have a tremendous boost in a lot of the cities where there are a lot of service workers."\nAfter the meeting, some of the participating mayors said they also discussed income inequality, early childhood education, the Detroit bankruptcy, and other issues specific to their cities.\n"It\'s very clear the president is focused on wages and benefits," said Bill de Blasio, the mayor-elect of New York City.\nThe mayors and mayors-elect in attendance, per the White House:\n-- Los Angeles, CA Mayor Eric Garcetti\n-- St. Petersburg, FL Mayor-elect Rick Kriseman\n-- Boston, MA Mayor-elect Martin Walsh\n-- Detroit, MI Mayor-elect Mike Duggan\n-- Minneapolis, MN Mayor-elect Betsy Hodges\n-- Jersey City, NJ Mayor Steven Fulop\n-- New York, NY Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio\n-- Rochester, NY Mayor-elect Lovely Warren\n-- Charlotte, NC Mayor-elect Patrick Cannon\n-- Greensboro, NC Mayor Nancy Vaughan\n-- Cincinnati, OH Mayor John Cranley\n-- Toledo, OH Mayor-elect D.

Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions is accusing the Obama administration of failing to enforce a century-old law meant to prevent immigrants from taking root in the U.S. only to live on the government dole -- after the administration reported it did not cite anyone for this last year.\n"Virtually no one one is being examined before they enter the country on whether or not they\'ll ... immediately begin to depend on government welfare," Sessions, R-Ala., top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, told Fox News.\nAs Congress weighs new immigration legislation, Sessions said any reform package "has got to end that."\nSessions turned up new statistics from the Department of Homeland Security last week showing what he describes as a startling trend. DHS reported how relatively few immigrants are being turned away on the grounds that they are likely to become a "public charge" -- or individuals who depend on welfare programs -- despite a 100-year-old law that\'s supposed to prevent this.\nThe department, blaming "data entry quality," said it did not have complete information on how many immigrants became public charges. But the department did a case-by-case review for the bulk of fiscal 2012, and found just one where that claim was leveled at an immigrant. "However, the charge was later withdrawn," DHS reported.\nFurther, the department reported that just a tiny fraction of people are rejected on these grounds when seeking entry under a program that allows admission for 90 days for travelers from certain countries. Between fiscal 2005 and most of fiscal 2012, a total of 9,796 were denied -- a fraction of a percent of those admitted. State Department figures for visa applications showed a similar trend, with just .068 percent of visa applications denied on those grounds in fiscal 2011.\nSessions has been hammering this issue for months. He and other Republican senators earlier wrote to the departments of Homeland Security and State arguing that a bedrock principle of immigration law is that "those who seek citizenship in this country ought to be financially self-sufficient."\nThe senator suggests the immigration system has produced a lopsided result in which high-skill immigrants are turned away while those who end up absorbing more taxpayer dollars than they contribute stay.\nRecent studies show welfare spending on immigrant-headed households is relatively high. A Center for Immigration Studies report found that 36 percent of these households were using "at least one major welfare program" in 2010 -- compared with 23 percent of other households.\nSessions\' office says the number of non-citizens on food stamps has skyrocketed in recent years. And the conservative Heritage Foundation claims low-skill immigrant households take in roughly $20,000 more in government benefits every year than they pay in taxes.\nSessions suggests the government is fueling this trend. He earlier made a stink over long-running U.S. Department of Agriculture radio "novelas" that depicted people being pressured into going on food stamps. The ads were later discontinued. The senator also is drawing attention to the WelcomeToUSA.gov site that provides information on a host of taxpayer assistance programs for immigrants, including Medicare, food stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and others.

WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - One of every seven Americans will take a hit on Friday when a $5 billion cut in food stamps, the first across-the-board reduction in the history of the decades-old federal program, takes effect.\nBut if conservative Republicans in Congress get their way, this week’s pullback may be just a taste of what’s to come for some of the almost 48 million Americans who receive benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\nSNAP, the largest U.S. anti-hunger program, is designed to help poor people - most of them children, disabled or elderly - buy food. But enrollment has doubled and the program’s cost has nearly tripled since 2004, and has remained at record levels even as the economy improves and unemployment declines.\nCritics say the surge shows reform is vital as part of federal deficit reduction. Defenders say the high enrollment is a sign of the weak recovery from the 2008-09 recession and sluggish job growth.\nThe cuts on Friday reflect the expiration of benefits authorized by the 2009 economic stimulus package, just as other temporary elements of the package - including a two-year payroll tax “holiday” - have ended over time.\nThe Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a think-tank that explores ways to reduce poverty, said benefits would drop by an average of 7 percent, or $10 per person per month.\nIn fiscal 2012, the average benefit per person was about $133 per month, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nAnti-poverty groups have for months warned of the dangers that the cuts pose to many vulnerable aid recipients. It will mark the first time benefits have declined for every recipient, regardless of need.\n“People are living at the margins,” said Ellen Vollinger, legal director and SNAP advocate at the Food Research and Action Center, an anti-hunger organization. “It’s not an abstract metric for people. It’s actual dollars to keep food in the refrigerator.”\nA family of three would lose $29 in benefits, enough to buy food for 16 meals at current “thrifty” rates, said Vollinger. That comes to $1.81 per meal.\nFor U.S. grocery store chains, the reduction may have only a minimal impact, equal to less than 1 percent of the about $715 billion a year spent by consumers on food and beverages for consumption at home. But the industry is highly competitive and operates on thin margins. Some chains are likely to feel a bigger impact than others.\nWith roughly one in seven Americans now enrolled in SNAP, the program currently accounts for a full 11 percent of total spending on “food at home,” as the government phrases it.\nRETAIL IMPACT MOSTLY MUTED\nPoor families might economize by squeezing spending on other goods and using the savings to supplement their food stamps. Recent declines in gasoline prices should provide an offset for now, said Scott Mushkin, a senior retail analyst at Wolfe Research.\n“They still need to eat,” said Mushkin.\n“Customers may shift to spending more of their own cash on food and less cash on other things,” said Keith Dailey, a spokesman for Kroger Co, the largest U.S. supermarket operator.\nBut Dennis Eidson, president of Spartan Stores Inc, a regional chain based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said the SNAP cut would be meaningful for sales. “We’re a little concerned about the food stamp cut, I can tell you that,” Eidson said.\nFruits and vegetables, grain products, meats, and dairy products comprise almost 90 percent of the food that SNAP households buy, according to the CBPP.\nWal-Mart Stores Inc, the discount giant that has the largest grocery sales in America, might fare better, U.S. Chief Executive Bill Simon said when analysts asked this month about the upcoming reduction.\n“When the benefits expanded, our market share actually went down,” said Simon, referring to 2009. “And so, our view is when price becomes more important ... we’re more relevant.”\nThe 2009 stimulus bill increased food stamps by an average of 18 percent, or around $24 a person, and it gave an immediate jolt to the economy. Benefits are spent quickly, and according to Moody’s Analytics, in a weak economy every dollar increase in SNAP benefits generates about $1.70 in economic activity.\nMost people who receive SNAP benefits live in households with very low income - about $8,800 a year on average in 2010, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.\nAs of July, the most recent figures available, 47.6 million were receiving food stamps, up 1.7 percent on the year. Enrollment has been above 47 million for the past 12 months.\nMORE CUTS EXPECTED IN NEW FARM BILL\nMore food stamp cuts - likely focused on reducing the number of beneficiaries - are expected to be included in the new U.S. farm bill, now in its final stage of preparation.\nConservative Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a bill in September that aimed to tighten SNAP eligibility standards and end benefits for nearly 5 percent of recipients, cutting some $39 billion over 10 years.\nOn Wednesday, negotiators from the House and Senate will start to hammer out a compromise version of the bill. Food stamps typically account for about 75 percent of money in the farm bill.\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor was the most prominent sponsor of the Republican-backed food stamp bill, which would shorten the time able-bodied adults without dependents could collect aid, and end a provision that allowed people with larger household assets to get food stamps.\nCantor has termed the program as it now stands an unaffordable burden on middle-class families that can be pruned while still helping “those who truly need it.”\nSome 1.7 million able-bodied adults would lose benefits through a stricter enforcement of work requirements that Republicans propose, the CBO estimates. Many states currently have waivers in place because of high jobless rates. The budget office also estimates that 2.1 million people would lose benefits if limits on assets are tightened.\n“By reforming food stamps, we will save the program for the truly needy,” said Virginia Foxx, a Republican Congresswoman from North Carolina. “An overextended, unchecked SNAP program won’t be capable of serving the citizens it’s purposed to help.”\nThe Democratic-run Senate has proposed $4.5 billion in savings over a decade by closing a loophole. A small-farm group said cuts of $8 billion to $12 billion might in the end be palatable to both the House and the Senate.\nPresident Barack Obama has warned against heavy cuts to food stamps. House Democrats have voted en bloc against large cuts. And 39 Democratic senators sent a letter to farm bill negotiators this week opposing “eligibility changes designed to erect new barriers to participation” in SNAP.\nMichael Tanner, author of a Cato Institute report that calls for converting food stamps into a block grant program run by the states, said lawmakers should overhaul the program’s rules. “These are a much better way to reform the program than just playing with the number,” Tanner said.

Despite the many differences I had with former President George W. Bush on a range of public policy issues, or as he called them, "decision points," I found common ground with him in one area, simply because we decided to put aside partisanship and do something good.\nHurricane Katrina\'s devastation and the bungled rescue efforts are seared in the national memory. Bush\'s "heckuva job" remark turned into a byword for government incompetence and public distrust. The shallowness of it coming at such a terrible and low point left deep wounds that are still healing. That was what it was.\nBut rather than rehash all that went wrong, I want to share what I believe to have been President Bush\'s determination to follow up on commitments, and the intense, personal, dedicated efforts he made to revive and restore people\'s futures. I know what I\'m talking about.\nKathleen Blanco, Louisiana\'s governor in 2005, asked me to serve on the state\'s commission overseeing the long-term recovery from the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. I\'ve kept a close watch over the last eight years.\nHurricane Katrina wasn\'t one natural disaster: It was a triple whammy of water, winds and lawlessness. An Army Corps engineer on CBS talked this week about Midwest flooding: "Water is the perfect instrument of destruction," he said. He is so right: Katrina\'s waters laid waste to an area the size of Great Britain. Its winds reached 174 mph and, together, they took 1,833 lives.\nEvery member of my family was displaced by Katrina. Last year, I lost both my father and sister. But I had them with me that much longer because they were rescued from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. My father, Lionel, left New Orleans only two times in his life. The first was to serve his country in Korea. The second was when FEMA evacuated him to San Antonio, Texas.\nMy older sister, Sheila -- people sometimes thought we were twins, we looked so much alike -- was in an assisted care home. Sheila developed a brain tumor in childhood. Brain surgery left her needing help, although she still managed to finish high school and college. When FEMA officials told me it might be weeks before we found Sheila, I was furious.\nCNN\'s Wolf Blitzer made a public plea for nearby citizens to see if the residents had survived. Eddie Rodriguez of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, and our cousin, Keith, a cop, rescued her from the building\'s rooftop. Most other residents had left before her. Sheila wouldn\'t leave until she saw someone she knew. Like so many others, she was relocated to Baton Rouge.\nMy 92-year-old great uncle Henry, a WWII vet, was plucked from another rooftop and transported to Roswell, Georgia, only to suffer a heart attack. All seven of my remaining siblings, my father, uncle, aunts, and other relatives, lost everything in Katrina. I was upset -- mad as hell -- and disappointed But, I made a decision not to act out -- act against Bush -- but rather to turn to his administration for help, and to offer my help.\nBitterness can corrode the soul. A grudge is like the chains on Marley\'s ghost. We can carry these chains in life and they weigh us down. President Obama and former President Bush have been working for eight years to change the atmosphere in Washington, to get Congress to move beyond pride and party.\nSo far, not even disasters or tragedies that have united the American people -- Hurricane Sandy, Sandy Hook, and Boston -- have moved the politicians. Not enough, anyway.\nBush understood the need for civility. I joined him despite my frustration because the need was too great for finger-pointing and blame-making. He flew to New Orleans and addressed the nation: "Tonight I also offer this pledge to the American people: Throughout the area hit by the hurricane, we will do what it takes. We will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives."\nGeorge W. Bush was good as his word. He visited the Gulf states 17 times; went 13 times to New Orleans. Laura Bush made 24 trips. Bush saw that $126 billion in aid was sent to the Gulf\'s residents, as some members of his own party in Congress balked.\nBush put a special emphasis on rebuilding schools and universities. He didn\'t forget African-Americans: Bush provided $400 million to the historically black colleges, now integrated, that remain a pride, and magnet for African-American students. Laura Bush, a librarian, saw to it that thousands of books ruined by the floods were replaced. To this day, there are many local libraries with tributes devoted to her efforts.\nIt was a team effort. I\'m glad to report the commission I served on went out-of-business in 2010. I\'m also grateful and proud to report that President Bush was one of the leaders, and a very important member, of that team. Our recovery can be credited to the civility and tireless efforts of President Bush and other Americans, who united and worked together to help rebuild the Gulf and the place of my birth, New Orleans.

Leaked classified documents show the U.S. National Security Agency and its British counterpart are among the "worst offenders" of mass surveillance without oversight, according to an open letter purportedly written by Edward Snowden and published Sunday by the German magazine Der Spiegel.\nThe publication of the letter, titled "A Manifesto for the Truth," comes as leaks by the former NSA contract analyst have roiled U.S.-European relations amid allegations that the NSA and the UK\'s Government Communications Headquarters monitored the communication data of some world leaders.\n"The world has learned a lot in a short amount of time about irresponsibly operated security agencies and, at times, criminal surveillance programs. Sometimes the agencies try to avoid controls," Snowden wrote, according to the news magazine.\n"While the NSA and GCHQ (the British national security agency) appear to be the worst offenders -- at least according to the documents that are currently public -- we cannot forget that mass surveillance is a global problem and needs a global solution."\nThe letter, published in German by Der Spiegel, was written on Friday in Moscow and provided to Der Spiegel through a "locked channel," the news magazine said. It was published in German and has been translated by CNN.\nSnowden, 30, has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified NSA documents, which revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic e-mails and telephone calls in the United States and monitor the cell phone and Internet activity of overseas residents. He is wanted in the United States on espionage charges.\nA recent report by Der Spiegel, citing documents provided by Snowden, alleged the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel\'s cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens.\nThe allegations have prompted some European countries to call for investigations. It also has prompted congressional hearings in the United States, where some are calling for more transparency and more oversight of American spy programs.\nThe letter also accused governments of trying to squash debate about mass surveillance "with a never before seen witch hunt" that threatens journalists and criminalizes the publication of details about the programs.\n"The debate they wanted to avoid is now taking place in countries around the world," the letter said.\n"And instead of causing damage, the use of this new public knowledge is causing society to push for political reforms, oversight and new laws."\nSnowden has been in Moscow since June after fleeing from Hong Kong. In August, Russia granted him asylum for one year.\nThe release of the open letter is the second in a matter of days from Snowden, who released a letter to German authorities through an intermediary.\nLast week, Hans-Christian Stroebele, a member of Germany\'s parliament, met with Snowden in Russia. Stroebele returned from the meeting with a letter from Snowden to German authorities, which was distributed to the media.\nIn it, Snowden said he is confident that with international support, the United States would abandon its efforts to "treat dissent as defection" and "criminalize political speech with felony charges."\n"I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of fact regarding reports in the media, particularly in regard to the truth and authenticity of documents, as appropriate and in accordance with the law," he wrote.\nBut earlier Sunday, White House Senior Adviser Dan Pfeiffer said on ABC\'s "This Week" that there has been no discussion of granting Snowden clemency.\n"Mr. Snowden violated U.S. law," Pfeiffer said. "And our belief has always been that he should return to the U.S. and face justice."\n"He had an opportunity -- if what he was, was a whistle-blower -- to pick up the phone and call the House Intelligence Committee, the Senate Intelligence Committee, and say, \'I have some information,\'" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on CBS\' "Face the Nation."\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said Snowden has to "own up with what he\'s done."\n"If he wants to come back and open up to the responsibility of the fact that he took and stole information, he violated his oath, he disclosed classified information -- that by the way has allowed three different terrorist organizations, affiliates of al Qaeda to change the way they communicate -- I\'d be happy to have that discussion with him," Rogers said on "Face the Nation."

More than $30 million in federal aid has been doled out to deceased farmers in recent years because of lax oversight by U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, according to a government audit.\nAn inspection by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office revealed that the USDA’s conservation and crop insurance programs failed to match subsidy claims against the Social Security Administration’s file of deceased individuals. The payouts went to about 4,500 farmers between 2008 and 2012.\nAccording to estimates in the report, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) made $10.6 million in payments to 1,103 deceased individuals for a year or more after their deaths. The Risk Management Agency (RMA) made $22 million in subsidies and allowances to 3,434 program policyholders for two or more years after death.\nThis is a drop in the bucket given the $20 billion the USDA spends yearly to help more than 1 million participants, says Bob Young, chief economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n“In the overall grand scheme of things, it was not a whole heck of a lot of money,” Young told Yahoo News. “Any dollar that is not spent properly is an issue, admittedly. But, wow, in terms of overall percentages of money that were put out of whatever, I thought it was kind of amazing that it was as small as it was.”\nThe USDA’s written response to the audit stated it “generally agrees with the report’s findings and recommendations” but defended the agencies by pointing out that the programs had close working relationships with participants and imposed yearly reporting.\n“Although NRCS and RMA can identify some deceased participants during their normal operations, we do not believe that identifying deceased individuals during normal operations is a reliable substitute for having a systematic process,” federal auditors wrote.\nYoung says he doubts very few farming families tried to deliberately fraud the government.\n“Sometimes you’ll end up with some time between when a person passes away and the time the estate gets restructured or whatever, and you’ll get a payment that gets caught in the middle,” Young says.\nThe RMA, the report notes, put a computer system in place and started checking claims against the government’s list of deceased persons in May.\nThe GAO’s fraud findings come at time when Washington is squabbling over the cost of the current farm bill, which expires in two months.\nIn its report to Congress, federal auditors said their findings “may call into question whether these safety net programs are benefiting the agriculture sector as intended.”

Not long ago I debated a Republican economic advisor on a cable TV program.

Why is there more anger, vituperation, and political polarization now than even during Joe McCarthy’s anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s, the tempestuous struggle for civil rights in the 1960s, the divisive Vietnam war, or the Watergate scandal?\nIf anything, you’d think this would be an era of relative calm. The Soviet Union has disappeared and the Cold War is over. The Civil Rights struggle continues, but at least we now have a black middle class and even a black president. While the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been controversial, the all-volunteer army means young Americans aren’t being dragged off to war against their will. And although politicians continue to generate scandals, the transgressions don’t threaten the integrity of our government as did Watergate.\nSign up for membership to become a founding member and help shape HuffPost’s next chapter\nAnd yet, by almost every measure, Americans are angrier today. They’re more contemptuous of almost every major institution — government, business, the media. They’re more convinced the nation is on the wrong track. And they are far more polarized.\nPolitical scientists say the gap between the median Republican voter and the median Democrat is wider today on a whole host of issues than it’s been since the 1920s.\nUndoubedly, social media play a part — allowing people to pop off without bearing much responsibility for what they say. And most of us can cocoon within virtual or real communities whose members confirm all our biases and assumptions.\nMeanwhile, cable news and yell radio compete for viewers and listeners by being ever more strident. Not long ago I debated a Republican economic advisor on a cable TV program. During the brief station-break, the show’s producer told me to “be angrier.” I told her I didn’t want to be angrier. “You have to,” she said. “Viewers are surfing through hundreds of channels and will stop for a gladiator contest.”\nWithin this cacophony, we’ve lost trusted arbiters of truth — the Edward Murrows and Walter Cronkites who could explain what was happening in ways most Americans found convincing.\nWe’ve also lost most living memory of an era in which we were all in it together — the Great Depression and World War II — when we succeeded or failed together. In those years we were palpably dependent on one another, and understood how much we owed each other as members of the same society.\nBut I think the deeper explanation for what has happened has economic roots. From the end of World War II through the late 1970s, the economy doubled in size — as did almost everyone’s income. Almost all Americans grew together. In fact, those in the bottom fifth of the income ladder saw their incomes more than double. Americans experienced upward mobility on a grand scale.\nYet for the last three and a half decades, the middle class has been losing ground. The median wage of male workers is now lower than it was in 1980, adjusted for inflation.\nIn addition, all the mechanisms we’ve used over the last three decades to minimize the effects of this descent — young mothers streaming into paid work in the late 1970s and 1980s, everyone working longer hours in the 1990s, and then borrowing against the rising values of our homes — are now exhausted. And wages are still dropping — the median is now 4 percent below what it was at the start of the so-called recovery.\nMeanwhile, income, wealth, and power have become more concentrated at the top than they’ve been in ninety years.\nAs a result, many have come to believe that the deck is stacked against them. Importantly, both the Tea Party and the Occupier movements began with the bailouts of Wall Street — when both groups concluded that big government and big finance had plotted against the rest of us. The former blamed government; the latter blamed Wall Street.\nPolitical scientists have also discovered a high correlationbetween inequality and political divisiveness.\nThe last time America was this bitterly divided was in the 1920s, which was the last time income, wealth, and power were this concentrated.\nWhen average people feel the game is rigged, they get angry. And that anger can easily find its way into deep resentments — of the poor, of blacks, of immigrants, of unions, of the well-educated, of government.\nThis shouldn’t be surprising. Demagogues throughout history have used anger to target scapegoats — thereby dividing and conquering, and distracting people from the real sources of their frustrations.\nMake no mistake: The savage inequality America is experiencing today is deeply dangerous.\nROBERT B.

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court usually isn\'t friendly toward questionable patents, but it came down overwhelmingly on the side of agribusiness giant Monsanto Monday in a case that\'s bound to resonate throughout the biotechnology industry.\nThe court ruled unanimously that an Indiana farmer violated Monsanto\'s patent on genetically modified soybeans when he culled some from a grain elevator and used them to replant his own crop in future years.\n"If simple copying were a protected use, a patent would plummet in value after the first sale of the first item containing the invention," Justice Elena Kagan ruled in a short 10-page opinion. "The undiluted patent monopoly, it might be said, would extend not for 20 years as the Patent Act promises, but for only one transaction. And that would result in less incentive for innovation than Congress wanted."\nWho it helps: Inventors and entrepreneurs who have patents on products that can be self-replicated, from computer software to cell lines. While Kagan\'s decision is limited to the Monsanto case, it bolsters the argument that self-replicating products can be protected from patent infringement even if their challengers go through third parties.\nWho it hurts: Consumers paying high prices. The Center for Food Safety released a report in February that showed three corporations control much of the global commercial seed market. It found that from 1995-2011, the average cost to plant 1 acre of soybeans rose 325%.\nWhat\'s to come: Still pending is a decision on whether human genes can be patented. That case tests a company\'s patent on the genes that can identify an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. During oral arguments in April, the justices seemed far more skeptical of the merits of that patent.\nMonsanto\'s soybeans represent the cream of the crop because they are resistant to the weed killer Roundup. Farmers must pay Monsanto\'s price to plant the beans themselves.\nThat\'s not what Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman did. After one year of going through Monsanto, he bought his second crop from a grain elevator. Then he used his own soybeans that resisted Roundup in future years -- in essence, the court said, making copies of a patented invention.\nBowman\'s attorney, Mark Walters, had argued that the Monsanto seeds were acquired innocently enough from the grain elevator, and that Bowman\'s little operation never would threaten the company\'s monopoly.\nTwo lower federal courts weren\'t impressed with Bowman\'s case, ruling in favor of Monsanto. And that argument carried little weight with the justices when the case was argued in February. They noted that Monsanto had spent hundreds of millions of dollars over more than a decade to perfect its soybeans -- something it would not have done if others could so easily replicate them.\nBowman contended the soybeans were "self-replicating," but Kagan said that "blame-the-bean defense" wasn\'t worthy.\n"Bowman was not a passive observer of his soybeans\' multiplication," she said. "Or, put another way, the seeds he purchased, miraculous though they might be in other respects, did not spontaneously create eight successive soybean crops.\n"It was Bowman, and not the bean, who controlled the reproduction (unto the eighth generation) of Monsanto\'s patented invention," Kagan said.\nMonsanto officials applauded the decision, not just for the company but for innovators of all shapes and sizes.\n"The court\'s ruling today ensures that longstanding principles of patent law apply to breakthrough 21st century technologies that are central to meeting the growing demands of our planet and its people," said David F. Snively, the company\'s executive vice president. "The ruling also provides assurance to all inventors throughout the public and private sectors that they can and should continue to invest in innovation that feeds people, improves lives, creates jobs, and allows America to keep its competitive edge."\nJim Greenwood, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, said the ruling will benefit all forms of biotechnology, "as well as the patients, farmers and consumers who benefit from biotechnology\'s help in healing, feeding and fueling the world."\nBut Center for Food Safety executive director Andrew Kimbrell called the ruling a setback for farmers. "The court chose to protect Monsanto over farmers," he said. "The court\'s ruling is contrary to logic and to agronomics, because it improperly attributes seeds\' reproduction to farmers, rather than nature."\nFordham University School of Law professor Mark Patterson noted the decision stops short of determining how self-reproducing inventions should be handled in all cases.\n"Justice Kagan, in the last paragraph of the opinion, noted that \'such inventions are becoming ever more prevalent, complex, and diverse,\'" Patterson said. "Either the court or Congress will have to address them again soon."

Bill Maher’s New Rules on the plea to raise the minimum wage is on point. It is hard to understand anyone’s objection to it. A country cannot frown on citizen’s using public assistance if it does not create an economy that pays a living wage to all its citizens that are working.\nThe following snippet with the most relevant bullets from his New Rules segment on the minimum wage is on point.\nBill Maher’s New Rules Snippet On The Minimum Wage\nWhen it comes to raising the minimum wage Conservatives always say it is a non-starter because it cuts into profits. … You might think that paying people enough to live is so self-evident that even crazy people could understand it. But you would be wrong. …\nMichele Bachmann is not only against raising the minimum wage, she is against having one at all. She wants said “… if we took away the minimum wage … we could … virtually wipe out unemployment … because we would be able to offer jobs at whatever level.” …\nAnd naturally Ted Cruz agrees. Ted Cruz thinks it’s a good thing that when his Cuban father came to America he was paid fifty cents an hour to work as a dishwasher. …\nWhen did the American dream become this pathway to indentured servitude, this economic death spiral where workers get paid next to nothing, so they can only afford to buy next to nothing, so businesses are forced to sell cheaper and cheaper shit?\nConsider the fact that most fast food workers whose average age by the way is 29 … are on some form of public assistance which is not surprising. When even working people can’t make enough to live they take money from the government.\nThis is the question the Right has to answer. Do you want smaller government with less handouts or do you want do you want a low minimum wage because you cannot have both. If Coronel Sanders isn’t going to pay the lady behind the counter enough to live on, then Uncle Sam has to. And I for one is getting a little tired of helping highly profitable companies pay their workers.\nBill Maher makes a very important statement. The average American citizens are subsidizing McDonald’s. Americans are subsidizing all companies that are paying below subsistence level wages.\nThe viral story of a McDonald’s employee calling a McDonald’s help line is probative. McDonald’s gave her information necessary to get government assistance and charity. This was a full time worker. What she really needs is an increase in the minimum wage. What she needs is the dignity of pay she can live on.\nBill Maher is late to the party. George Carlin figured out long time ago that the American Dream had become a pathway to indentured servitude. He laid it out in his “The American Dream” standup skit. The minimum wage is part of the problem. However, the problem of the poor and working middle class is much deeper.\nThe problem is income and wealth disparity that is getting worse. Income and growth is extracted from the poor and the middle class with policies to ensure the incessant steady growth of the wealth and income of a very few.

Something terrible has happened to the soul of the Republican Party. We’ve gone beyond bad economic doctrine. We’ve even gone beyond selfishness and special interests. At this point we’re talking about a state of mind that takes positive glee in inflicting further suffering on the already miserable.\nThe occasion for these observations is, as you may have guessed, the monstrous farm bill the House passed last week.\nFor decades, farm bills have had two major pieces. One piece offers subsidies to farmers; the other offers nutritional aid to Americans in distress, mainly in the form of food stamps (these days officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP).\nLong ago, when subsidies helped many poor farmers, you could defend the whole package as a form of support for those in need. Over the years, however, the two pieces diverged. Farm subsidies became a fraud-ridden program that mainly benefits corporations and wealthy individuals. Meanwhile food stamps became a crucial part of the social safety net.\nSo House Republicans voted to maintain farm subsidies — at a higher level than either the Senate or the White House proposed — while completely eliminating food stamps from the bill.\nTo fully appreciate what just went down, listen to the rhetoric conservatives often use to justify eliminating safety-net programs. It goes something like this: “You’re personally free to help the poor. But the government has no right to take people’s money” — frequently, at this point, they add the words “at the point of a gun” — “and force them to give it to the poor.”\nIt is, however, apparently perfectly O.K. to take people’s money at the point of a gun and force them to give it to agribusinesses and the wealthy.\nNow, some enemies of food stamps don’t quote libertarian philosophy; they quote the Bible instead. Representative Stephen Fincher of Tennessee, for example, cited the New Testament: “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.” Sure enough, it turns out that Mr. Fincher has personally received millions in farm subsidies.\nGiven this awesome double standard — I don’t think the word “hypocrisy” does it justice — it seems almost anti-climactic to talk about facts and figures. But I guess we must.\nSo: Food stamp usage has indeed soared in recent years, with the percentage of the population receiving stamps rising from 8.7 in 2007 to 15.2 in the most recent data. There is, however, no mystery here. SNAP is supposed to help families in distress, and lately a lot of families have been in distress.\nIn fact, SNAP usage tends to track broad measures of unemployment, like U6, which includes the underemployed and workers who have temporarily given up active job search. And U6 more than doubled in the crisis, from about 8 percent before the Great Recession to 17 percent in early 2010. It’s true that broad unemployment has since declined slightly, while food stamp numbers have continued to rise — but there’s normally some lag in the relationship, and it’s probably also true that some families have been forced to take food stamps by sharp cuts in unemployment benefits.\nWhat about the theory, common on the right, that it’s the other way around — that we have so much unemployment thanks to government programs that, in effect, pay people not to work? (Soup kitchens caused the Great Depression!) The basic answer is, you have to be kidding. Do you really believe that Americans are living lives of leisure on $134 a month, the average SNAP benefit?\nStill, let’s pretend to take this seriously. If employment is down because government aid is inducing people to stay home, reducing the labor force, then the law of supply and demand should apply: withdrawing all those workers should be causing labor shortages and rising wages, especially among the low-paid workers most likely to receive aid. In reality, of course, wages are stagnant or declining — and that’s especially true for the groups that benefit most from food stamps.\nSo what’s going on here? Is it just racism? No doubt the old racist canards — like Ronald Reagan’s image of the “strapping young buck” using food stamps to buy a T-bone steak — still have some traction. But these days almost half of food stamp recipients are non-Hispanic whites; in Tennessee, home of the Bible-quoting Mr. Fincher, the number is 63 percent. So it’s not all about race.\nWhat is it about, then? Somehow, one of our nation’s two great parties has become infected by an almost pathological meanspiritedness, a contempt for what CNBC’s Rick Santelli, in the famous rant that launched the Tea Party, called “losers.” If you’re an American, and you’re down on your luck, these people don’t want to help; they want to give you an extra kick. I don’t fully understand it, but it’s a terrible thing to behold.

City officials in this San Francisco suburb passed an ordinance this past week prohibiting city contractors from ever inquiring about many job applicants\' criminal histories.\nThe move in this city of 100,000 people, which is troubled by crime and high unemployment, is part of a growing national trend that supporters say is designed to improve the community\'s employment prospects amid wider incarceration.\n[pullquote]\nUnder the ordinance, approved by the City Council in a 6-1 vote and set to take effect in September, private companies that have city contracts and that employ more than nine people won\'t be able to ask anything about an applicant\'s criminal record; otherwise they would lose their city contracts. The ordinance is one of the nation\'s strictest "ban-the-box" laws, which are so called because many job applications contain a box to check if one has a criminal record.\n[summary]\n"Once we pay our debt, I think the playing field should be fair," said Andres Abarra of Richmond, who was released from San Quentin State Prison in 2006 after serving 16 months for selling heroin. Abarra, 60 years old, said he lost his first job out of prison, at a warehouse, about a month after a temporary agency hired him. The agency ran a background check and "let me go on the spot," he said. He now works for an advocacy group called Safe Return that campaigned for the ordinance.\nOthers say the laws potentially endanger both employers and the public. "We have a responsibility to protect our customers, protect other employees and then the company itself" from potential crime, said Kelly Knott, senior director for government relations of the National Retail Federation, an industry group in Washington, D.C., which hasn\'t taken a position on ban-the-box laws but has cautioned against federal guidance that could limit how employers use background checks.\nRichmond, with a population of about 100,000, joins 51 other municipalities that have passed similar ordinances, many in the past five years. Last year, Newark, N.J., barred private employers and the city government from inquiring into a job applicant\'s criminal history until they have made a conditional offer of employment, and employers can only take into consideration certain offenses committed within the past five to eight years.\nMurder, voluntary manslaughter and sex offenses requiring registry can be inquired about no matter how much time has passed.\nTen states also have enacted ban-the-box legislation, according to the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit group that advocates for the laws. Many of those laws don\'t apply to job applications for "sensitive" positions, such as those involving work with children.\nMichelle Rodriguez, a NELP staff attorney, said tougher sentencing laws in recent decades, particularly for drug crimes, have sent more people to prison, making post-incarceration unemployment a broader problem. "It really could be anybody who has a criminal record now—your co-worker, your neighbor," Ms. Rodriguez said. "And it doesn\'t mean they\'re a criminal. It means they had a run-in with the law."

Here are the 36 votes against Sandy relief, a $50.5 billion emergency spending bill to aid victims of super storm Sandy. It passed in a 62-36 vote in the Senate Monday evening,\nSteve Benen did a little math with these votes. In the House, 78 percent of Republicans voted against emergency aid. In the Senate, those 36 votes represent 80 percent of Republicans. The overwhelming majority of Republicans, well more than three-quarters, now approach natural disasters as political fodder, another opportunity to push deficit hysteria and to force massive cuts to other domestic spending. Tax cuts to the wealthy? Those pay for themselves. Rebuilding destroyed communities populated by millions of Americans? Only if you cut other government programs. In other words, the vast majority of Republicans are assholes.\nBut the king of the assholes, at least on this vote, is Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, number three on that list up there of votes against Sandy relief. Let's rewind to May 2011.\nST. LOUIS (KMOX) - Missouri Senator Roy Blunt says he’s asking the federal government to reimburse 100 percent of the cost to local governments dealing with the Joplin tornado aftermath. [...]\n“I’m asking for 100 percent federal reimbursement to local governments,” Blunt said, “They’ve agreed to 75. I think they have to come to a better number than that, and the right number, I think, would be 100 percent.”\nNote what's not included in that demand: offsets.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel\'s speed cameras generated 2,722 tickets at four parks during the first month, city transportation officials said Tuesday.\nAn additional 24,000 warnings have gone out to drivers found speeding at those locations, Deputy Transportation Commissioner Scott Kubly said.\nThe numbers provide a snapshot now that the city\'s first group of speed cameras is beyond a 30-day grace period and the system is issuing tickets of $100 and $35. During the first month each camera is up, speeders get unlimited warnings at those locations. After that, drivers caught speeding by the cameras still get one warning. Then the actual tickets start.\nThe 2,722 tickets issued cover Oct. 16 through Sunday near Gompers, McKinley, Garfield and Marquette parks. Two cameras at Gompers Park began issuing citations Oct. 16 and seven cameras at the other three parks began generating tickets by Oct. 25.\nOn Monday, four more cameras began generating tickets near Washington, Douglas and Legion parks, for a total of 13 cameras citywide that are beyond the grace period.\nCity ordinance allows for $35 tickets for drivers going 6 to 10 mph over the speed limit and $100 tickets for drivers going 11 mph or more over the limit. Currently, the Emanuel administration says it is not issuing tickets for drivers going 6 to 9 mph over the limit.\nDuring the first week of tickets at the first four parks with cameras, there were an average of 211 speeding violations per day, according to city figures. By the third week of tickets, that daily average had dropped to 175, transportation officials said.\n"They are working," Kubly said of the cameras. "We\'re seeing speeding drop pretty dramatically here within the first month."\nUp to 300 cameras can be installed across the city under current rules. The Emanuel administration can place cameras within an eighth of a mile of the city\'s parks and schools, which a Tribune analysis showed could cover nearly half the city.\nCity transportation officials have said they hope to have 50 cameras operating by year\'s end. The Emanuel administration has not said how many cameras it would like to add next year but has projected $60 million to $70 million in revenue for the cameras for 2014, a number several aldermen have said is likely to be much higher.

One of the nation\'s best-known charities is paying disabled workers as little as 22 cents an hour, thanks to a 75-year-old legal loophole that critics say needs to be closed.\nGoodwill Industries, a multibillion-dollar company whose executives make six-figure salaries, is among the nonprofit groups permitted to pay thousands of disabled workers far less than minimum wage because of a federal law known as Section 14 (c). Labor Department records show that some Goodwill workers in Pennsylvania earned wages as low as 22, 38 and 41 cents per hour in 2009.\n"If they really do pay the CEO of Goodwill three-quarters of a million dollars, they certainly can pay me more than they\'re paying," said Harold Leigland, who is legally blind and hangs clothes at a Goodwill in Great Falls, Montana for less than minimum wage.\n"It\'s a question of civil rights," added his wife, Sheila, blind from birth, who quit her job at the same Goodwill store when her already low wage was cut further. "I feel like a second-class citizen. And I hate it."\nSection 14 (c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which was passed in 1938, allows employers to obtain special minimum wage certificates from the Department of Labor. The certificates give employers the right to pay disabled workers according to their abilities, with no bottom limit to the wage.\nMost, but not all, special wage certificates are held by nonprofit organizations like Goodwill that then set up their own so-called "sheltered workshops" for disabled employees, where employees typically perform manual tasks like hanging clothes.\nThe non-profit certificate holders can also place employees in outside, for-profit workplaces including restaurants, retail stores, hospitals and even Internal Revenue Service centers. Between the sheltered workshops and the outside businesses, more than 216,000 workers are eligible to earn less than minimum wage because of Section 14 (c), though many end up earning the full federal minimum wage of $7.25.\nHarold Leigland, who is blind, with his guide dog on the bus during his morning commute to the Goodwill facility in Great Falls, Montana, where he works hanging clothing.\nWhen a non-profit provides Section 14 (c) workers to an outside business, it sets the salary and pays the wages. For example, the Helen Keller National Center, a New York school for the blind and deaf, has a special wage certificate and has placed students in a Westbury, N.Y., Applebee\'s franchise. The employees\' pay ranged from $3.97 per hour to $5.96 per hour in 2010. The franchise told NBC News it has also hired workers at minimum wage from Helen Keller. A spokesperson for Applebee\'s declined to comment on Section 14 (c).\nHelen Keller also placed several students at a Barnes & Noble bookstore in Manhasset, N.Y., in 2010, where they earned $3.80 and $4.85 an hour. A Barnes & Noble spokeswoman defended the Section 14 (c) program as providing jobs to "people who would otherwise not have [the opportunity to work]."\nMost Section 14 (c) workers are employed directly by nonprofits. In 2001, the most recent year for which numbers are available, the GAO estimated that more than 90 percent of Section 14 (c) workers were employed at nonprofit work centers.\nCritics of Section 14 (c) have focused much of their ire on the nonprofits, where wages can be just pennies an hour even as some of the groups receive funding from the government. At one workplace in Florida run by a nonprofit, some employees earned one cent per hour in 2011.\n"People are profiting from exploiting disabled workers," said Ari Ne\'eman, president of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. "It is clearly and unquestionably exploitation."\nDefenders of Section 14 (c) say that without it, disabled workers would have few options. A Department of Labor spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News that Section 14 (c) "provides workers with disabilities the opportunity to be given meaningful work and receive an income."\nTerry Farmer, CEO of ACCSES, a trade group that calls itself the "voice of disability service providers," said scrapping the provision could "force [disabled workers] to stay at home," enter rehabilitation, "or otherwise engage in unproductive and unsatisfactory activities."\nHarold Leigland, however, said he feels that Goodwill can pay him a low wage because the company knows he has few other places to go. "We are trapped," he said. "Everybody who works at Goodwill is trapped."\nLeigland, a 66-year-old former massage therapist with a college degree, currently earns $5.46 per hour in Great Falls.\nHis wages have risen and fallen based on "time studies," the method nonprofits use to calculate the salaries of Section 14 (c) workers. Staff members use a stopwatch to determine how long it takes a disabled worker to complete a task. That time is compared with how long it would take a person without a disability to do the same task. The nonprofit then uses a formula to calculate a salary, which may be equal to or less than minimum wage. The tests are repeated every six months.\nLeigland\'s pay has been higher than $5.46, but it has also dropped down to $4.37 per hour, based on the time-study results.\nHe said he believes Goodwill makes the time studies harder when they want his wage to be lower.\n"Sometimes the test is easier than others. It depends on if, as near as I can figure, they want your wage to go up or down. It\'s that simple," he said.\nHis wife, Sheila, 58, spent four years hanging clothes at the Great Falls Goodwill for about $3.50 an hour. She said the time study was one of the most degrading and stressful parts about her job. "You never know how it\'s going to come out. It stressed me out a lot," she said.\nShe quit last summer when she returned to work after knee surgery and found that her wage had been lowered to $2.75 per hour, a training rate.\n"At $2.75 it would barely cover my cost of getting to work. I wouldn\'t make any money," she said.\nHarold said he believes Goodwill can afford to pay him minimum wage, based on the salaries paid to Goodwill executives. While according to the company\'s own figures about 4,000 of the 30,000 disabled workers Goodwill employs at 69 franchises are currently paid below minimum wage, salaries for the CEOs of those franchises that hold special minimum wage certificates totaled almost $20 million in 2011.\nIn 2011 the CEO of Goodwill Industries of Southern California took home $1.1 million in salary and deferred compensation. His counterpart in Portland, Oregon, made more than $500,000. Salaries for CEOs of the roughly 150 Goodwill franchises across America total more than $30 million.\nGoodwill International CEO Jim Gibbons, who was awarded $729,000 in salary and deferred compensation in 2011, defended the executive pay.\n"These leaders are having a great impact in terms of new solutions, in terms of innovation, and in terms of job creation," he said.\nGibbons also defended time studies, and the whole Section 14 (c) approach. He said that for many people who make less than minimum wage, the experience of work is more important than the pay.\n"It\'s typically not about their livelihood. It\'s about their fulfillment. It\'s about being a part of something. And it\'s probably a small part of their overall program," he said.\nAnd Goodwill and the organizations that run the sheltered workshops are not alone in their support for Section 14 (c). In many cases, the families of the workers who have severe disabilities say their loved ones enjoy the work experience, enjoy getting a paycheck, and the amount is of no consequence.\nSheila Leigland, who is blind, with her guide dog. She quit her job at Goodwill in Great Falls, Montana, after her hourly wage was lowered to $2.75.\n"I feel really good about it. I don\'t have to worry so much about him," said Fran Davidson, whose son Jeremy has worked at Goodwill in Great Falls, Montana, for more than a decade. "I know he\'s not getting picked on, and he\'s in a safe place. He enjoys what he\'s doing, and he\'s happy, and that\'s what we like for our kids." Jeremy started out working for a sub-minimum wage but did well on his last time study and is currently earning $7.80 an hour, Montana\'s minimum wage.\nBut foes of Section 14 (c) have hopes for a new bill that\'s now before Congress that would repeal Section 14 (c) and make sub-minimum wages illegal across the board.\n"Meaningful work deserves fair pay," the sponsor of the bill, Rep. Gregg Harper, R.-Miss., told NBC News. "This dated provision unjustly prohibits workers with disabilities from reaching their full potential."\nThe bill is opposed by trade associations for the employers of the disabled, and past attempts to change the law have failed. But Marc Maurer, president of the National Federation of the Blind and a foe of the sheltered workshop system, is cautiously optimistic that this time the bill will pass, and end what he called a "two-tiered system."\nThat system, explained Maurer, says "\'Americans who have disabilities aren\'t as valuable as other people,\' and that\'s wrong. These folks have value. We should recognize that value."\nMonica Alba contributed to this report.\nMore from Open Channel:\nFollow Open Channel from NBCNews.com on Twitter and Facebook\nInvestigate this!\nRead and vote on readers\' story tips and suggested topics for investigation or submit your own.\nPopular Discussio

NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Republican Governor Bobby Jindal said on Thursday he wants to eliminate all Louisiana personal and corporate income taxes to simplify the state’s tax code and make it more friendly to business.\nThe governor did not release details of his proposal, but his office released a statement confirming that the taxes are targets of a broader tax reform plan.\n“Our goal is to eliminate all personal income tax and all corporate income tax in a revenue neutral manner,” Jindal said in the statement.\nHe did not confirm reports that he will seek an increase in sales taxes in order to offset lost income tax revenue, but said: “We want to keep the sales tax as low and flat as possible.”\nPolitical analyst John Maginnis, who on Thursday reported in his email newsletter LaPolitics Weekly that Jindal will propose balancing the tax loss by raising the sales tax, now at 4 percent, said the strategy fits with the governor’s interest in keeping a high national profile.\n“Just proposing a plan on the scale being discussed would win Jindal acclaim among fiscal conservatives here and nationwide,” Maginnis told Reuters.\nJindal is often mentioned for national office including the U.S. Senate and as a possible presidential candidate.\nLouisiana’s neighbor Texas has had no income tax for years, relying on a windfall from its rich energy resources and other forms of taxation. Other states in the region governed by Republicans are trying to copy Texas, including Oklahoma and Kansas, which have both considered lowering taxes.\nBut political analyst Maginnis questioned whether the Republican-majority Louisiana legislature would endorse Jindal’s ambitious plan.\n“Any tax increase (such as sales tax) or elimination of exemptions would require a two-thirds vote, a form of legislative approval that would require (Republican) solidarity and significant Democratic support,” Maginnis said.\nJindal said his team will meet with lawmakers soon to discuss details of his tax reform plan.\n“Eliminating personal income taxes will put more money back into the pockets of Louisiana families and will change a complex tax code into a more simple system that will make Louisiana more attractive to companies who want to invest here and create jobs,” he said.

(AP)\nOrganized labor and big business have reached a deal on a new, low-skilled workers program that will help clear the way for Capitol Hill immigration reform, but President Obama and a leading Republican senator maintain cautious optimism about a final deal.\nThe deal was reached during a Friday night phone call between AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka and U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief executive Tom Donohue, according to several news organizations and confirmed by Fox News.\nThe deal was brokered by New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, who also was on the phone call and is one of eight senators working on bipartisan reform legislation.\n"This issue has always been the dealbreaker on immigration reform, but not this time," Schumer said.\n"The strength of the consensus across America for just reform has afforded us the momentum needed to forge an agreement in principle to develop a new type of employer visa system," Trumka said in a statement late Saturday. "We expect that this new program, which benefits not just business, but everyone, will promote long overdue reforms by raising the bar for existing programs."\nDespite the breakthrough, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio’s office cautioned Saturday that Congress still has a long way to go before passing legislation in the Democrat-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House.\nRubio sent a letter Saturday to Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., calling for a deliberate hearing process on the new legislation and cautioning against a "rush to legislate."\n“Senate negotiators are making good progress on immigration reform, but we\'re not done yet,” Rubio press secretary Alex Conant tweeted Saturday.\nWhite House spokesman Clark Stevens said Obama continues to be encouraged by the progress being made by the bipartisan group of senators.\n“We look forward to seeing language once it is introduced and expect legislation to move forward as soon as possible,” he said.\nA source told The Associated Press, on the condition of anonymity, the deal resolves disagreements over wages for new, low-income workers and which industries would be included.\nAll members of the so-called Gang of Eight are expected to sign off on the agreement.\nThe remaining big hurdles to passage are securing the U.S. borders, cracking down on employers who hire illegally and creating a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country.\nThe bipartisan group is expected to introduce the bill officially the week of April 8, after Congress returns from a two-week recess.\nThe AFL-CIO and the Chamber had been fighting over wages for tens of thousands of low-skilled workers who would be brought in under the new program to fill jobs in construction, hotels and resorts, nursing homes and restaurants and other industries.\nOn Friday, officials from both sides said there was basic agreement on the wage issue, and Schumer said a final deal on the worker dispute was very close.\n"We\'re feeling very optimistic on immigration: Aspiring Americans will receive the road map to citizenship they deserve and we can modernize `future flow\' without reducing wages for any local workers, regardless of what papers they carry," AFL-CIO spokesman Jeff Hauser said in a statement earlier this week. "Future flow" refers to future arrivals of legal immigrants.\nUnder the emerging agreement between business and labor, a new "W" visa program would bring tens of thousands of lower-skilled workers a year to the country. The program would be capped at 200,000 a year, but the number of visas would fluctuate, depending on unemployment rates, job openings, employer demand and data collected by a new federal bureau pushed by the labor movement as an objective monitor of the market.\nThe workers would be able to change jobs and could seek permanent residency. Under current temporary worker programs, personnel can\'t move from employer to employer and have no path to permanent U.S. residence and citizenship. And currently there\'s no good way for employers to bring many low-skilled workers to the U.S. An existing visa program for low-wage nonagricultural workers is capped at 66,000 per year and is supposed to apply only to seasonal or temporary jobs.\nThe Chamber of Commerce said workers would earn actual wages paid to American workers or the prevailing wages for the industry they\'re working in, whichever is higher. The Labor Department determines prevailing wage based on customary rates in specific localities, so that it varies from city to city.\nThe low-skilled worker issue had loomed for weeks as perhaps the toughest matter to settle in months-long, closed-door talks on immigration among the senators, including Republicans John McCain, Arizona, and Rubio.\nThe issue helped sink the last major attempt at immigration overhaul in 2007, when the legislation foundered on the Senate floor after an amendment was added to end a temporary worker program after five years, threatening a key priority of the business community.\nThe amendment passed by just one vote, 49-48. Obama, a senator at the time, joined in the narrow majority voting to end the program after five years.\nThe president, who won roughly 71 percent of the Hispanic vote during his November re-election, has made immigration reform a key part of his second term. And Republicans are attempting to improve their relationship with Hispanics, the fasting growing segment of the U.S. populations.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

President Barack Obama put a spotlight on rising income inequality in a major economic speech on Wednesday, arguing that the disparity poses a "fundamental threat" to the American dream.\nMarshaling both the recent papal exhortation by Pope Francis and a flurry of statistics reflecting a growing income gap between the wealthiest Americans and most others, Obama urged Washington to adopt policies to address the economic divide.\n"The combined trends of increased inequality and decreasing mobility pose a fundamental threat to the American dream, our way of life, and what we stand for around the globe," Obama said at a speech in Washington, D.C. hosted by the progressive think tank Center for American Progress.\nWhile delivering remarks on poverty, inequality and the decreasing economic mobility of the middle class, President Obama declares that \'we are a better country than this\' and these injustices should compel citizens to action.\nObama called for a litany of proposals -- a higher minimum wage, stronger labor laws and a budget which promotes both education and social safety programs -- that he said would provide better economic stability for families in the aftermath of the recession that took hold as he first took office in 2009.\nAnd, as Congress again approaches a mid-January budget deadline that could threaten another government shutdown or further spending cuts, the president said that addressing inequality was a more urgent challenge than further cutting the budget.\n"A growing deficit of opportunity is more of a threat to our future than our rapidly shrinking fiscal deficit," he said.\nMany of the proposals pushed by Obama on Tuesday are unlikely to go anywhere on Capitol Hill, however. As lawmakers gear up for their own re-election efforts in 2014, Republicans in particular seem disinclined to help advance most parts of the president\'s agenda.\nContinuing with a recent theme, the president in turn challenged Republicans in Congress to detail their own proposals to address health care or wages or other social ills instead of simply opposing his own plans.\n"You owe it to the American people to tell us what you are for," Obama said, "not just what you\'re against."\nObama\'s remarks came almost two years to the day after a particularly notable speech he delivered in Osawatomie, Kansas about the same themes. Obama visited the small Kansas town because it was where Theodore Roosevelt had detailed many of the pillars of progressivism in 1910.\nObama\'s 2011 speech in Osawatomie was also seen as an informal statement of his case for re-election, outlining themes he would use successfully to beat Republican candidate Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.\nNow, a year removed from his comfortable victory over Romney, many of Obama\'s initiatives have stalled in the Republican-held House of Representatives. Much of 2013 has been consumed by fiscal showdowns and an unwillingness in the House to even bring up some of Obama\'s top economic priorities, like comprehensive immigration reform or the Employee Non-Discrimination Act.\nIndeed, as Obama delivered his remarks, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, took to the House floor to accuse Obama and the Democratic Senate of being the primary impediments to economic growth.\nPresident Barack Obama speaks at the Town Hall Education Arts Recreation Campus December 4, 2013 in Washington, DC.\n"The Senate and the president continue to stand in the way of the American people’s priorities," Boehner said, according to prepared remarks, referencing a stalled budget agreement and farm bill, among other issues. "When will they learn to say \'yes\' to common ground? When will they start listening to the American people?"\nSomewhat anticipating the Republican response, Obama suggested that GOP appeals to free enterprise are an insufficient response.\n"It\'s not enough anymore to just say we should get our government out of the way and let the unfettered market take care of it, for our experience tells us that\'s just not true," he said.\nObama\'s speech was also a clarion call to his liberal base, a band of supporters that has been discouraged in recent weeks by the troubled launch of HealthCare.gov, which has harmed the president\'s approval ratings and threatened to weigh on Democrats in next year\'s elections.\nThe issue of income inequality has increasingly become an animating issue on the American left, as progressive champions like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth warren, D, and others speak more forcefully about the issue. Inequality -- and how to best address it -- is poised to become one of the animating issues for Democrats in the coming years, especially during the 2016 presidential primary.\n"We know that people\'s frustrations run deeper than these most recent political battles," Obama said, giving voice to some of those arguments. "It\'s rooted in the nagging sense that no matter how hard they work, the deck is stacked against them. And it\'s rooted in the fear that their kids won\'t be better off than they were."\nThis story was originally published on Wed Dec 4, 2013 12:31 PM EST\nPopular Discussio

Library of Congress\nWASHINGTON — In the pursuit of justice, what is unjustified? Are there limits to what may be done in service to a righteous cause? Abstract philosophical questions, perhaps, but also political ones. And in thinking about the Civil War, the answers affect our understanding of that bloody conflict.\nThis is one reason the Library of Congress exhibition “The Civil War in America,” which opened late last year in honor of the war’s sesquicentennial, is so fascinating. It doesn’t explicitly ask questions about means and ends, but we can’t help thinking about them as the letters, diaries, documents and images accumulate.\nThe war left 620,000 dead (the most recent scholarship suggests as many as 750,000) and much of the South in ruins. But it also resulted in the elimination of an institution now understood as an absolute evil: slavery. In the quest to abolish that evil, what would have been unjustified? John Brown’s prewar terrorism had ardent supporters; Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman’s ruthless march to the sea was viewed as a successful Union strategy.\nJudging from recent films the idea of the ends justifying the means is now widely associated with the battles fought. Quentin Tarantino’s “Django Unchained” takes place just before the Civil War but celebrates a once-enslaved black man exacting vengeance against an evil plantation owner who makes Simon Legree look genteel.\nAnd Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln” is appealing not just because of Daniel Day-Lewis’s performance but also because the president is shown as both saintly in his quest — pressing for the elimination of slavery in the 13th Amendment — and ruthless in his righteousness, allowing arm-twisting, lies and bribery in his pursuit of the legislative good. In both films hints of excess in service to virtue are readily cheered and all opposition made to look corrupt and worse.\nBut this vision of heroism does not do full historical justice to either the Civil War or Lincoln. We may like our heroes unchained, prepared to transcend ordinary restrictions, but history is another matter. What were the ends sought? How were they pursued? And what effects did that have? The Library of Congress exhibition tries to see the conflict from different perspectives. Its displays of over 200 items, we are told, “attest to the valor, sacrifices, emotions and accomplishments of those in both the North and South whose lives were affected by the bitter conflict of 1861-65.”\nThe war, it explains, “unfolds between two opposing ideologies,” with the Union opposed by a “confederacy of slaveholding states true to their own interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.” It is as if this show, presented by a national institution in the nation’s capital (with Cheryl Regan as exhibition director), wants to avoid — even after 150 years — any hint of partisanship.\nAt first it seems as if the exhibition will try to seesaw between sides, creating a kind of symmetry. The American Civil War Center in Richmond, Va., does something like that, shading the conflict with hints of relativism. And there remain important differences between Northern narratives and those of many Southern museums. But at the Library of Congress the lineaments remain clear.\nSlavery, of course, is at the center. In honor of the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation its first draft, handwritten by Lincoln, will be on display until Feb. 18. Shown here too is an extraordinary map published by the United States Coast Survey in 1861, shaded to show the concentration of the country’s 3,952,838 slaves in Southern counties. It was said to have been consulted by Lincoln throughout the war; its darkened regions, stained by slavery, coincide with ports and rivers and plantations.\nWe see too how American political life was affected by slavery. Political compromise could be a tightrope walk. On display are Lincoln’s emendations to his first Inaugural Address delivered in March 1861. We learn that the address carefully avoids “alienating the South,” as the exhibition puts it. Lincoln explicitly repudiates any interference with the practice of slavery where it existed. And this was after the Confederate States of America had already been declared.\nThe exhibition leads us chronologically through the resulting maelstrom. The 1862 Congressional Directory here reminds us not only of the legislature’s half-empty chambers but also of the free play of Northern interests in passing major laws that year, including the Homestead Act (providing settlers free farmland west of the Mississippi) and the Pacific Railroad Act (leading to the transcontinental railroad).\nThe show’s documents are also dense with voices, offering a history told from above and below as well as from North and South. (A companion volume takes a similar approach in a detailed timeline of the war.) An 1861 diary of a plantation proprietor in South Carolina suggests that merely by being exposed to Northern forces “the Institution of Slavery has received a blow that it will never recover from.” From days of privation in 1863 we see a Confederate cookbook with recipes for imitation oysters and apple pie without apples.\nWe glimpse free black citizens in the midst of war. A letter from Frederick Douglass’s son Lewis, who was a member of the all-black 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, was written after fighting a “terrible” and “desperate” battle over Fort Wagner in Charleston Harbor. And in an 1868 book Elizabeth Keckley, a former slave and dressmaker for Mary Lincoln, describes establishing the Contraband Relief Association to help the 40,000 slaves who fled to freedom in Washington.\n“Contraband” was the term given to slaves who escaped rebel territory. In a seeming paradox, by being regarded as war-won booty, escaped slaves could be “confiscated” and thus freed. That concept helped shape the Emancipation Proclamation.\nThe proclamation shows how Lincoln shaped the war. He acted not as we see him in Spielberg’s “Lincoln,” prepared to jettison propriety for the sake of principle, but as someone scrupulously legalistic. The proclamation is not inspiring, and it isn’t meant to be. It is a strategic document, a tactic, not a moral standard. It frees slaves only in rebel states and regions. It was announced in advance as an incentive to end that rebellion (in which case slaves would have remained slaves). Slaves in loyal border states like Delaware or Kentucky were unaffected.\nLincoln wrote the proclamation not as president but as commander in chief, which gave him some control over rebel property. The only way to abolish slavery, in his view, was through the use of law. When the capital’s slaves were freed in 1862, we learn here, a Baltimore slave trader was hired to determine compensation to owners.\nThis meticulousness was necessary because for Lincoln the Union as a legal and social structure was paramount. The abolition of slavery did not trump the Union, but the Union would make it possible to abolish slavery.\nIn a handwritten draft here of Lincoln’s 1863 letter to James C. Conkling, meant to be read publicly, Lincoln says that it shouldn’t matter if his friend did not want to fight “to free negroes”:\n“Fight you, then, exclusively to save the Union. I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the Union. Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the Union, if I shall urge you to continue fighting, it will be an apt time then for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes.”\nThis focus on the Union is not a matter of political realism. It is actually a different vision of the war. And Lincoln’s perspective doesn’t readily fit into the moral categories we now use. It bypasses notions of good and evil. So while Lincoln embraces a moral vision, he also demands a structure for pursuing it and generally resists stretching its strictures. A spirit of rigor combines with a populist vision. This is the democratic grandeur of Lincoln.\nFor all its virtues Mr. Spielberg’s film makes Lincoln into a different hero. He is first made more saintly by the focus on the 13th Amendment, as if abolition had been his primary goal. And his apparently unsavory manipulations then become a homily: This is what must be done in pursuit of a righteous cause. But that interpretation seems primarily supported by words of Representative Thaddeus Stevens, spoken in the film but actually reported only secondhand more than 40 years later. Stevens supposedly said that the amendment was “passed by corruption, aided and abetted by the purest man in America.”\nBut what of the war itself? How is it to be recalled? As a battle of ideologies? As good confronting evil? One of the final items in the exhibition is Frederick Douglass’s 1871 address at the Graves of the Unknown Dead; he objects to being asked to remember “with equal admiration” both “those who fought for slavery, and those who fought for liberty and justice.”\n“If I forget the difference,” he asks, “in the name of all things sacred, what shall men remember?”\nLincoln might have dissented. For him there was simply the guiding structure of the Union, which, with all its imperfections and negotiations, was both the means and the end.

They will likely appeal the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals within the next 30 days, their lawyer Richard Martinez told The Huffington Post.\n“This case is not over,” Martinez said. “It’s not only important to Arizona, but to the country as a whole that this statute be addressed.”\nArizona Attorney General Tom Horne began a campaign to eliminate the Mexican-American Studies program from Tucson Unified School District in 2006, when he was serving as the state’s Superintendent of Public Education.\nAngered that Mexican-American civil rights leader Dolores Huerta had said that “Republicans hate Latinos” in a speech to Tucson students, Horne sent Deputy Superintendent Margaret Dugan, a Latina Republican, to give an alternate view. But the intellectual exercise turned confrontational when students, who said they were not allowed to ask Dugan questions, sealed their mouths with tape and walked out of the assembly room.\n“As superintendent of schools, I have visited over 1,000 schools and I’ve never seen students be disrespectful to a teacher in that way,” Horne said in an interview last year.\nThe final product of his efforts was House Bill 2281, which then-State Sen. John Huppenthal (R) helped pilot through the Arizona legislature. Huppenthal, who succeeded Horne as state superintendent of schools, then found Tucson out of compliance with the new law and ordered the district to shut Mexican-American Studies down or lose 10 percent of its annual funding — some $14 million over the fiscal year. In January of 2012, the school board complied, voting 4 to 1 to discontinue the classes.\nThe decision drew national attention as administrators plucked Latino literature that once belonged to the curriculum from classrooms, explicitly banning seven titles from instruction.\nTashima wrote in Friday’s ruling that Horne’s anti-Mexican-American Studies zeal bordered on discrimination.\n“This single-minded focus on terminating the MAS (Mexican-American Studies) program, along with Horne’s decision not to issue findings against other ethnic studies programs, is at least suggestive of discriminatory intent,” Tashima wrote.\nBut the federal judge stopped short of invalidating the law on those grounds.\n“Although some aspects of the record may be viewed to spark suspicion that the Latino population has been improperly targeted, on the whole, the evidence indicates that Defendants targeted the MAS program, not Latino students, teachers or community members who participated in the program,” the judge wrote in the ruling.\nNot everyone agrees.\nWriter and activist Tony Diaz — who along with independent journalist Liana Lopez and multimedia artist Bryan Parras launched a “librotraficante” caravan to “smuggle” books banned from Tucson classrooms into Arizona — said the court had “failed our youth, our culture and freedom of speech” by upholding the Arizona ethnic studies law.\n“But we remain inspired by the youth of Tucson, the teachers, the families, the activists who will appeal this unjust ruling and continue the struggle to the Supreme Court,” Diaz said.

Julian Whittington, the sheriff of Bossier Parish, LA, that Obama’s Justice Office of Civil Rights de-funded the chapter and another youth program over mentions of religion. In the case of the Young Marine program, chartered in 1965, the funding was cut off because the group features an oath that mentions “God.” In the other case, it was because a program for at-risk youth featured a voluntary, student-led prayer session as one of its activities.

OXNARD, Calif. – A middle school teacher who was fired after students learned she had appeared in pornography has lost her appeal to return to the classroom, her lawyer said Tuesday.\nA three-judge panel unanimously decided Stacie Halas, 32, was unfit for the classroom. Halas was fired in April from her job as a science teacher at Haydock Intermediate School in Oxnard after online videos of her in porn were discovered by students and teachers.\n"Although (Halas\') pornography career has concluded, the ongoing availability of her pornographic materials on the Internet will continue to impede her from being an effective teacher and respected colleague," Judge Julie Cabos-Owen wrote in a 46-page decision issued Friday by the Commission on Professional Competence.\nHalas was continually deceitful about her nine-month career in porn before she went to work at the school, the decision said.\nHer lawyer Richard Schwab said Halas had tried to be honest but was embarrassed by her previous experience in the adult industry.\n"Miss Halas is more than just an individual fighting for her job as a teacher," he said Tuesday. "I think she\'s representative of a lot of people who may have a past that may not involve anything illegal or anything that hurts anybody."\nHalas has been on administrative leave since the video surfaced in March.\nStudent claims that the teacher was moonlighting as a porn star were initially dismissed after school officials said they couldn\'t find any images of her on the Internet — but they were using the school\'s computers, which don\'t allow access to porn.\nTeachers then showed administrators downloads of Halas\' sex videos from their smartphones.\nIn hearings, former assistant principal Wayne Saddler testified that at the start of a sex video, Halas talked about being a teacher and he felt her effectiveness in the classroom had been compromised.\nAfter rumors of her performance surfaced, profanity was etched on Halas\' classroom window, a teacher testified.\nSchwab has said Halas did not star in pornographic movies while teaching in any district. He said she took parts only during an eight-month period from 2005 to 2006 because of financial problems after her boyfriend abandoned her.\nDistrict superintendent Jeff Chancer applauded the commission\'s ruling.\nHalas\' decision to "engage in pornography was incompatible with her responsibilities as a role model for students and would present an insurmountable, recurring disruption to our schools should she be allowed to remain as a teacher," Chancer said in a statement.

The premise of Obama’s claim is at odds with recent global survey data, which that the U.S. is among the least racist countries in the world. It is also at odds with the record of his own political career. In the recent past, President Obama has been guilty of many of the sins described above–s of illegal immigrants; opposing gay marriage ; out of campaign photographs for fear of arousing prejudice; and, most notoriously, paying women less than men in both his and offices.

Soros backing what his Open Society Foundation calls “immigrant rights” groups and projects. Some of those projects, like Soros’ National Immigration Forum-backed Evangelical Immigration Table (EIT), were meant to create the illusion of grassroots support for amnesty where there was none. released by NumbersUSA, conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, shows that Evangelical Republican likely voters disagree with the push for amnesty despite the Soros group’s claims there is grassroots support among Evangelicals for the policy.

Ruth Fremson/The New York Times\nIn July, two dozen accomplished women — bankers, law firm partners and technology executives — sat Christine C. Quinn down in a conference room in the Met Life building for some honest talk about her quest to become New York’s first female mayor.\nThey were getting worried, they told her, as they watched her slip in the polls and struggle to respond to attacks.\nThe participants, including Mary Ann Tighe, the real estate executive, and Diana L. Taylor, girlfriend of the current mayor, warned Ms. Quinn that a woman seeking power always faced perils and that the very qualities that had brought her this far — drive, ambition, toughness — could make her unlikable to many.\nBut Ms. Quinn was not interested in talking about that.\n“I don’t get up in the morning thinking about how I’ll approach this as a woman or a lesbian; I think about the issues,” she said, according to an organizer of the session.\nAfterward, a few of the women privately concluded that Ms. Quinn just did not get it. She needs a voice coach, one said, and a less naïve attitude about the magnitude of the gender challenge she faced.\nMs. Quinn’s resistance to the conversation says a lot about her: She can be unbending, and determined, and she wanted her campaign to be focused on her competence and accomplishments, not her gender.\nBut her fall from front-runner status to a distant third place finish in the Democratic primary is now stirring intense debate about whether her femaleness, or her homosexuality, played any role in her struggle to win over voters.\nExit polls showed no gender gap in the results and indicated that Ms. Quinn lost for a number of reasons — her close association with the plutocratic incumbent mayor, her rivals’ ability to outmaneuver her on the issue of stop-and-frisk policing, and her inability to be a change candidate in an election in which voters sought new direction.\nStill, her supporters wonder: Why has New York, home of tough, talented women like Eleanor Roosevelt and Anna Wintour, proven resistant to female candidates? And was it simply too much to expect the electorate to embrace a candidate who would be not just New York’s first female mayor, but its first openly gay one, too?\nIn interviews with allies and opponents, as well as members of the Quinn campaign team, not one person blamed her loss wholly, or even mostly, on gender.\nBut many of them also said that watching her candidacy was like seeing scenes from a depressingly familiar movie — a bad local remake of Clinton 2008.\nDemocratic voters who expressed unfavorable views of Ms. Quinn in New York Times/Siena College polls described her in follow-up interviews as “ambitious,” “petty,” “mean,” “bossy,” “self-interested,” “defensive,” “combative” and “argumentative.”\nShe was the target of an unusual level of visceral hatred, including a band of protesters who screamed at her on the street and interrupted her events.\nMen, and some women, regularly called her voice grating.\n“Nice lady, but if I have to listen to that voice for four years, I’ll die,” John A. Catsimatidis, a Republican candidate, said.\nSometimes voters said flatly that they did not like her because she is a lesbian. Others had difficulty articulating why they were put off by her.\n“I don’t really like her,” said Scott Smith, 49, who lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and works in construction, adding that she seemed “too masculine, I guess, not enough feminine.”\nCritiques of Ms. Quinn’s physical attributes came from many corners, even the wealthy Upper East Side women who helped raise money for her mayoral bid. “Why can’t she dress better?’” they would ask Rachel Lavine, a Democratic state committeewoman who was on Ms. Quinn’s finance committee.\n“I might think that St. John is not the end all and be all of fashion,” Ms. Lavine said, referring to the upscale clothing line favored by wealthy, older women. “But that’s what they’re saying. ‘Why isn’t she wearing a size two St. John’s dress?’ There’s that kind of constant commentary.”\nReferring to Ms. Quinn’s rival Bill de Blasio, she said, “You don’t hear that about de Blasio — ‘Why can’t he buy better-looking suits?’ ”\nMs. Lavine said that on the occasions that she had tried to engage Ms. Quinn’s most strident opponents, the conversation often devolved into insults about Ms. Quinn’s appearance. She said they would call her “ugly” or “fat” or that her red hair made her look like a clown.\nMs. Quinn never blamed her problems during the race on sexism or homophobia. Still, her inner circle debated how to grapple with the question of gender.\nSome supporters wanted a more direct appeal to female voters early on, and Emily’s List, the influential national political action committee that backs Democratic women, endorsed her in January, hoping it would generate excitement among women.\nBut her advisers preferred to play down a gender-specific message as she emphasized her ability to get things done. In fact, Ms. Quinn seldom raised her gender until the final stretch of the primary, when she was clearly behind, making her pitch seem more desperate.\nThe last-minute plea clearly did not work. In perhaps the most painful twist for the candidate, Democratic women rejected her, voting for Mr. de Blasio instead, by more than two to one, according to exit poll results from Edison Research.\n“There is a perception that women will support women, and that’s just not necessarily true,” said Wendy Greuel, who lost a brutal race for the mayor in Los Angeles earlier this year, and is friendly with Mr. de Blasio from their days in the Clinton administration. “You cannot run a race where you expect people to do that.”\nOf the 10 largest cities in the United States, only one has a female mayor — Annise D. Parker in Houston. And as the City Council speaker, Ms. Quinn is already an outlier; the state and city are considered tough terrain for female candidates.\nSome of New York’s highest-profile elected women have been exceptions: Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton, who catapulted into the state from the White House, and Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who was first appointed to a vacant seat.\n“Democratic party politics, dominated by men, have been less hospitable for women in New York,” Ester Fuchs, a professor of political science at Columbia, said. Women are “getting into the primaries but they’re not winning,” she added.\nPart of the problem, she said, is that contrary to the hopes of Ms. Quinn and her campaign aides, women almost never vote as a bloc in city races, in which issues like abortion figure very little.\nWithout a women’s vote, a gay vote — which never really materialized — or a powerful ethnic affiliation, like with Jews or Hispanics, she said, Ms. Quinn was left without a base.\n“She’s Irish,” Ms. Fuchs pointed out, noting that many Irish voters have left the city. “That was a bigger problem for her than anything.”\nBut true to the concerns of the women who met with Ms. Quinn in July, some allies thought the campaign could have handled the tricky matter of being a woman candidate with more finesse.\nGloria Steinem said in an interview that Mr. de Blasio effectively “took over the language of gender” in the race with his proposal to expand preschool programs with a tax increase. (The proposal was widely seen as impractical but politically effective.)\nEven though Ms. Quinn passed a Council bill to provide paid sick leave, she stalled action on the measure for so long that she was widely viewed as an opponent, which hurt her credibility as a fighter for women.\nShe veered between projecting toughness and vulnerability; a memoir in which she discussed her teenage bulimia and battle with alcohol struck many as a plea for sympathy.\nMs. Steinem, who endorsed Ms. Quinn, said that the city’s very might makes it more difficult for women to break through. “Wherever there is more power, there is more opposition,” she said, adding, “If you’re tough enough to run New York City, you’re too tough to be considered acceptably feminine.”\nAt Ms. Quinn’s post-primary party on Tuesday night at a Chelsea hotel, supporters seemed to still be absorbing her fall.\nYoung female volunteers in “Team Quinn” shirts hugged and Liz Abzug, daughter of Bella, poured out her frustration about how little had changed in the 36 years since her mother’s unsuccessful run for mayor.\nAfter the crowd interrupted Ms. Quinn with cries of “You’re not done!” and “Governor!” she delivered her variation on what has now become the standard line for every woman who loses.\n“This may not be the outcome you wanted, but there’s a young girl out there who was inspired by the thought of New York’s first woman mayor,” she said. She looked upbeat, but her wife’s eyes were glossy with tears.

New legislation which will limit the paparazzi\'s ability to photograph stars\' children has become law in the state of California.\nBill 606, championed by actress Halle Berry, who testified before the state assembly, sets out to protect the children of those in the public eye.\nIt lays out penalties for taking photos and video of a child without parental consent and in a harassing manner.\nIt would be "the beginning of the end," Berry said, for "aggressive paparazzi".\nEarlier this week, it was signed into California law by state governor Jerry Brown.\n"I started this fight with a great deal of hope and a bit of uncertainty so I cannot express my immense gratitude that Gov. Brown has recognized, and acted to remedy, the plight of children who are tormented because of the identity or prominence of their parents," said Berry.\nThe Academy award-winning actress was seen shouting at photographers taking pictures of her family after arriving at Los Angeles International airport in April, with her partner Olivier Martinez and her daughter.\nPregnant Berry also thanked actress Jennifer Garner and British singer Adele for joining her in her fight.\n"I am forever in awe of the support I got within my community from the enormously talented musician Adele to fellow actor Jennifer Garner, who travelled with me to Sacramento to share her children\'s stories, experience and her desire to give them a better life."\nThe law comes into effect in January. Those breaking it could receive between 10 days and one year in jail, as well as a fine of up to $10,000 (£6,252).\nThe bill also allows for parents to bring a civil action against violators to seek damages and legal fees.\n"Kids shouldn\'t be tabloid fodder," said Senator Kevin de Leon, who put forward the bill, adding that the new law "will give children, no matter who their parents are, protection from harassers who go to extremes to turn a buck".\nThe Motion Picture Association of America was among several groups that opposed the legislation, saying it infringes upon free speech protections.\nMr De Leon\'s office claimed the bill does not infringe on First Amendment rights because it targets the photographer\'s conduct, not the act of taking a photograph.\nOther organisations in opposition include the National Press Photographers Association and the California Broadcasters Association.\n"It is for all of us that I rejoice today and hope that this fight will continue and that the proper enforcement of this law will truly make a positive impact on the daily lives of all children," said Berry.

3/5 of a person. That should be familiar. It is how slaves were counted for purposes of representation (and taxation) in the U. S. House in the original Constitution:\nRepresentatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.\nAnd as one could read about the proposal in Virginia to change how the state awards its electoral votes, in A Message To The Virginia GOP From A Plantation, a blog post by Paul Bibeau earlier this week,\nThis plan counts the votes of Obama supporters, or Democrats, or "urban people" - Have I used the right code words here? Do we know who we\'re talking about? - less than other Virginians.\nBut you need to do the actual math. No one on your side - at least I hope no one on your side - has crunched the numbers. Last election, Barack Obama won 51.16% of the vote. Under the new bill he would have won four of the states 13 electoral votes.\nAnd do you know how much it counts an Obama voter as? (It\'s 4/13 divided by 51.16%. I\'ll wait. Do it. Get a calculator. You\'ll crap yourself.)\nIT IS ALMOST EXACTLY THREE FIFTHS.\nThis bill counts an Obama voter as 3/5 of a person. I don\'t know if that fraction rings a bell with you. It was kind of a big deal, way back when. Women in fancy dresses, guys in gray - a lot of gray was in style. Is the light coming on now?\nH/T to Charles M. Blow, who references the Bilbeau post in his NY Times column today, titled Rig the Vote, which is worth reading ....\nand please continue below the fold for just a few words more.\nBlow\'s final two paragraphs, which come immediately after referencing Bibeau, read as follows:\nThat is because, as Talking Points Memo says, “Obama voters would have received almost exactly 3/5 of the electoral vote compared to their actual population — 30.7 percent of the electoral vote over 51 percent of the popular vote.”\nThis is not where we should be in 2013, debating whether to pass bills to reduce urban voters to a fraction of the value of other voters and hoping that someone with the power to stop it thinks it’s a “bad idea.”\nThe bill will not become law in Virginia. A key Republican state senator opposes it, so it might not even get out of committee in the state senate; the Lt.

Most here saw the Tea Party assholes for what they were long ago. Well, they showed up without their Klan hoods to show themselves to the world at President Obama\'s speech in Arizona:\nObama foes at one point sang, "Bye Bye Black Sheep," a derogatory reference to the president\'s skin color, while protesters like Deanne Bartram raised a sign saying, "Impeach the Half-White Muslim!"\nMany on both sides wore red, white and blue and carried small flags.\nship\n“He needs to go back to where he came from because obviously, he is a liar,” she said. “I am not racist. I am part Indian. Obama’s half Black, half White.”\n“He’s 47 percent Negro,” shouted Ron Enderle, a 77-year-old Chandler resident who said that he and his son served as Marines and his grandson is currently serving in the Marines.\nsnip\n“We have gone back so many years,” she said. “He’s divided all the races. I hate him for that.”\nArizona Republic\nThis is today\'s Republicans. Bunch of fucking ignorant bigots.\nI\'m proud to have voted for Barack Obama.\nUpdate I: Went to a baseball game right after I wrote this (Unfortunately the Dodgers are kicking the Cards asses tonight). Arizona Blue had sent me some links to other diaries on this several hours ago. Here they are for your reading pleasure:

3/5 of a person. That should be familiar. It is how slaves were counted for purposes of representation (and taxation) in the U. S. House in the original Constitution:\nRepresentatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.\nAnd as one could read about the proposal in Virginia to change how the state awards its electoral votes, in A Message To The Virginia GOP From A Plantation, a blog post by Paul Bibeau earlier this week,\nThis plan counts the votes of Obama supporters, or Democrats, or "urban people" - Have I used the right code words here? Do we know who we\'re talking about? - less than other Virginians.\nBut you need to do the actual math. No one on your side - at least I hope no one on your side - has crunched the numbers. Last election, Barack Obama won 51.16% of the vote. Under the new bill he would have won four of the states 13 electoral votes.\nAnd do you know how much it counts an Obama voter as? (It\'s 4/13 divided by 51.16%. I\'ll wait. Do it. Get a calculator. You\'ll crap yourself.)\nIT IS ALMOST EXACTLY THREE FIFTHS.\nThis bill counts an Obama voter as 3/5 of a person. I don\'t know if that fraction rings a bell with you. It was kind of a big deal, way back when. Women in fancy dresses, guys in gray - a lot of gray was in style. Is the light coming on now?\nH/T to Charles M. Blow, who references the Bilbeau post in his NY Times column today, titled Rig the Vote, which is worth reading ....\nand please continue below the fold for just a few words more.\nBlow\'s final two paragraphs, which come immediately after referencing Bibeau, read as follows:\nThat is because, as Talking Points Memo says, “Obama voters would have received almost exactly 3/5 of the electoral vote compared to their actual population — 30.7 percent of the electoral vote over 51 percent of the popular vote.”\nThis is not where we should be in 2013, debating whether to pass bills to reduce urban voters to a fraction of the value of other voters and hoping that someone with the power to stop it thinks it’s a “bad idea.”\nThe bill will not become law in Virginia. A key Republican state senator opposes it, so it might not even get out of committee in the state senate; the Lt. Gov opposes it, and since he has already said he will not break 20-20 ties that are strictly partisan (and the senate is split 20-20 between the two parties) even if it reached the floor he seems committed to killing it; and the Governor opposes it, so even were it to reach his desk he seems committed to vetoing it.\nIt is worth noting that unlike the two states that now distribute electoral votes by Congressional district (Maine which has never split, and Nebraska which in 2008 gave on e EV to OBama) and as far as I know ALL other current proposals, rather than giving the two EV votes equivalent to the two senators to the candidate winning the statewide total, the Virginia proposal would award the final two EVS to the candidate winning the majority of the Congressional districts, not the majority of the state\'s votes.

Oh, Texas. What to do with you.\nSo mere hours after the Supreme Court struck down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, Texas wasted no more time and re-instituted the same redistricting plan the courts had already ruled as unconstitutional. The same with their new voter suppression bill.\nAttorney General Holder was having none of it, however. Texas was the first lawsuit to be filed by the Justice Department under Section 2 of the Voting Right Act.\nAnd now Texas is presenting its defense. It is using two main arguments.\nAnd boy, are they doozies.\nJump below the Chee-to for more:\nFirst, says Attorney General Greg Abbott, the redistricting is not about race. Oh no. It\'s about not allowing DEMOCRATS to vote. White Democrats too.\nFrom their brief:\nDOJ’s accusations of racial discrimination are baseless. In 2011, both houses of the Texas Legislature were controlled by large Republican majorities, and their redistricting decisions were designed to increase the Republican Party’s electoral prospects at the expense of the Democrats....The redistricting decisions of which DOJ complains were motivated by partisan rather than racial considerations, and the plaintiffs and DOJ have zero evidence to prove the contrary. It is perfectly constitutional for a Republican-controlled legislature to make partisan districting decisions, even if there are incidental effects on minority voters who support Democratic candidates.\nTranslation:\n"So, basically, we just want to fuck over all Democrats, and if the Black and Brown people are also hurt, well, they shouldn\'t vote for Democrats, should they? It\'s only collateral damage"\nYou know, having them actually come right out and say it--that they don\'t want Democrats to vote--is somehow not surprising. But it\'s good that they\'re doing it at last.\nBut wait! There\'s more. To address the actual accusations of racial bias and discrimination, Texas is using the argument that "Yeah, there may be an isolated incident or two, but it\'s NOTHING like it was in 1965".\nFrom the article, which says it better than I can:\nFurthermore, the state claims, even if Texas did discriminate, and the state stresses that it did not, it was nothing as bad as “the ‘pervasive,’ ‘flagrant,’ ‘widespread,’ and ‘rampant’ discrimination that originally justified preclearance in 1965.” So as long as Texas skies aren’t alight with flames from burning crosses, what’s the big whoop?\nSo, according to this, Texas is arguing that Section 2, and in fact the entire reasons for preclearance are all based on conditions in 1965. And that since "things are better than in 1965" then Section 2 is null and void.\nI think the fact that Texas is second only to Mississippi in Section 2 lawsuits is the basis for this particular argument.\nHowever, there is a danger here. Texas is arguing that ONLY conditions that existed in 1965 would justify Federal supervision of the elections process. Sort of like an "originalism to the extreme" argument.\nAnd that can be dangerous because there are those on the Supreme Court that would like nothing more than the total eradication of the Voting Rights Act.\nNot to mention the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments, but that\'s another story.

So I am overjoyed about what happened in Texas, not the least because it was so unexpected, and so....freaking great. I loved every minute of it, and can\'t tell you how happy I am to have a new Democratic hero in Wendy Davis.\nI want to make this very clear, so people will understand what is in my heart as I write this diary. I watched the breathless news tonight on MSNBC, and I saw Kos\'s effort to draft MS. Davis to run for governor, and I\'m all over it all.\nBut there was a part of me that felt SO sad too. I remember when Wisconsin\'s capitol was filled w/that kind of crowd for WEEKS ON END. I remember when Democrats and progressives in Wisconsin filled not only the rotunda of their capitol, but all the real estate they could in every direction OUTSIDE the capitol, for WEEKS ON END.\nAnd most here at the DK, supported the effort, and it was thrilling. Then came the recall, and we lost. I could say why I think this happened, but it doesn\'t matter. It just did. And since then, despite all those thrilling hopeful days, things have only gotten worse in Wisconsin.\nAnd one of the biggest ways that has happened, is the Wisconsin republican answer to seeing THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN, as long as they\'re in power. They have made endless laws to make sure of that. And now, what happened in Texas last night, will be very difficult for Wisconsin to match. It\'s crazy. Possible in Texas, almost impossible in Wisconsin.\nThose of us caught up on the new laws and restrictions regarding what is allowable in the state house, and who can be there, and under what conditions, know how fast after the loss of the recall the GOP clamped down on seeing to it that nothing like the anti Walker uprising would happen again on their watch. I could go on for many paragraphs here telling you how specific and restrictive those new laws are. I could roll your socks back as to the totalitarian and successful cap the Wisconsin GOP has put on anything like what happened in Texas yesterday, and what happened in Wisconsin, week after week, at one time not so long ago.\nRecently, the Republican Wisconsin legislature voted to pass a law similar to what was at stake in Texas. The "gallery" was highly restricted. Women w/tape over their mouths---to signify protest to the new rules of their being there---were told to remove the tape or be arrested. They removed the tape and covered their mouths w/their hands. Some Democrats in the chamber tried to shout their way into their right to be heard.\nBut in the end, Mike Ellis broke his gavel telling everyone to shut the fuck up, they would NOT be heard. This disgraceful behavior was shown here a bit on video, and God bless her, on Rachel Maddow\'s show. Other than that, crickets. The nation has left the story of Wisconsin behind. We tried, we lost, and journalism is not about losers.\nI CHEER what happened in Texas yesterday with all my heart. BUT, beware of the media story on your side today. Because it can be gone tomorrow. And don\'t underestimate the response of republicans when they have been so challenged. I\'ll bet you the little money I have in the bank, that Texas too will soon have a bunch of laws that make it impossible for what happened yesterday to happen again. The only reason they aren\'t there now in Texas, is because what happened surprised the hell out of them. Don\'t doubt for a minute that they\'re gathered in back rooms as I write this, figuring out to make sure it never happens to them again.\nI cheer every minute of attention Texas gets w/this, and I cheer Wendy Davis. I don\'t want it to go away. But I know it will. My message here is not about cynicism, or about "don\'t bother." IT. IS. NOT.\nMy message is that we are on the brink of so much in this country, and we have to find a way to stop letting them get away with this. And that means in Wisconsin too, no matter how gerrymandered it is. I frankly don\'t know how to do this. But I do know the answer is NOT to bow out from the fight in a heap of disappointment and anger. And I don\'t for a minute suggest that\'s what Wisconsin Democrats are doing. BUT, everything is so much harder for them now.\nWisconsin must find a way to rise again, and Texas must find a way to hold on to this win. And part of that is seeing what\'s coming. And I\'m telling you what\'s coming in Texas. Somehow, some way, we must stop this. And that means we have to decide our priorities as Democrats. And there in lies the rub. And I have no answer for it.

Yes, if the Republicans are smart, all they have to do is nothing and wait for the Dems to act to offer any kind of cuts. Let the sequestration take in effect because at this point they know that this is the best they are going to get as far as any cuts taking place. Obama threatens sequester (he actually promised to veto any attempts to do away with the sequester), then he rants to the public and warns against the dangers of it, then blame Republicans if this goes through.

Care to explain why they were voted into their second-largest majority in the House since 1948?\n\nMaybe the public is just becoming immune to the "doom and gloom" the Democrats always like to project if ANY spending cuts are actually made.\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport  \n \nJ. Willard Marriott \n #330.2 \n\n\nI will be happy to explain. Because of Gerrymandering only 35 of the 435 house seats are in play. Despite this, the GOP lost 8 seats. 1.4 million more people voted for Democrats than did Republicans for House seats, Gerrymandering limited the gain to 8.\n\nYou didn\'t know that, now you do.\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport  \n \nTexan1211 \n #330.3 \n\n\nI suppose the Democrats held the majority in Congress for the largest part of time since 1960 because they DIDN\'T gerrymander, right?\nBOTH sides gerrymander, Willard. Get over it!\nAnd when total votes cast in ALL districts in ALL states are they way Congressional votes are counted, let me know!\nHmmmm.......a district in California might have 500,000 voters. Say it votes 80% Democrat to 20% Republican. Let\'s say a district in Oklahoma has 50,000 voters, and votes 80% Republican and 20% Democrat. Now we have a representative from EACH party, but obviously the Democrats recieved more votes. THAT\'S how Democrats recieved more votes.\nPresident Obama has personally led the GOP to their two largest majorities in the House since 1948! Thanks!!!!!!\nStill waiting for you to explain how sequestration passed the Senate, controlled by Democrats, and why President Obama signed it!\n\nAnd why 2.25% reduction in federal spending will devastate us after TWO summers of recovery!\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport  \n \nJ.

What spending are you willing to cut to replace it?&rdquo; Well, White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer has responded with a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/02/19/setting-record-straight-about-sequester">&ldquo;setting the record straight&rdquo; blog post</a> pointing out 1) Obama does have a plan to replace the sequester cuts, 2) Boehner had boasted in the past that the sequester was leverage to extract entitlement cuts, and 3) the House GOP has yet to pass a plan in this Congress to replace the sequester. And today, Obama is conducting interviews with eight local TV stations (including some military-heavy markets like San Antonio and Honolulu) to pressure Republicans to come to an agreement to avoid the sequester. But here&rsquo;s a question we have: Is the public listening anymore?</p>\n<p>*** <b>To count, we&rsquo;re on our fifth and sixth fiscal standoff since 2011</b>: After all, we&rsquo;re now on our fifth fiscal standoff since Republicans took over the House in 2011 (the threatened government shutdown, the debt ceiling, the Super Committee, the fiscal cliff, and now the sequester). And later in March, we&rsquo;ll see our sixth standoff (another battle over shutting down the government). Each time in the past, Democrats and Republicans have come to some sort of agreement that avoids the looming fiscal disaster but that also kicks the larger can down the road. So what happens if the sky doesn&rsquo;t fall -- immediately -- after March 1? In fact, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/us/politics/dire-forecast-on-effects-of-budget-cuts.html?hp&_r=1&">New York Times</a> notes that while these looming sequester spending cuts will have an impact on the economy, they&rsquo;re unlikely to have an immediate effect. &ldquo;Rather, they will ripple gradually across the federal government as agencies come to grips in the months ahead with across-the-board cuts to all their programs.&rdquo; If that&rsquo;s the case, does this kind of public campaign we&rsquo;re seeing (Obama arguing that essential jobs will be lost, Republicans pinning the blame on the president) actually work? It&rsquo;s something to chew on as both sides begin to wage a furious P.R. campaign before March 1. By the way, check out Wall Street -- record highs all over the place. Translation: Wall Street has stopped fearing Washington. They now only hear &ldquo;posturing&rdquo; when the two sides talk, and if Wall Street doesn&rsquo;t believe the threats coming out of Washington, then the public might not be far behind.</p>\n<figure><img alt="" src="https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/130220_boehner_4x3.380;380;7;70;0.jpg"></img></figure>\n<p>*** <b>Brace yourself for the Supreme Court to eliminate all campaign-contribution limits</b>: As NBC&rsquo;s Pete Williams reported yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to delve into the controversial issue of money and politics -- again. This time, the court agreed to take up a challenge brought by an Alabama man who claims it\'s unconstitutional to prevent him from giving more than $46,200 to candidates and $70,800 to PAC\'s and political committees, Williams notes. The Alabama man doesn&rsquo;t challenge the limit on contributions to an individual candidate, but he does claim it\'s unconstitutional to prevent him from contributing to as many candidates as he wishes. What every political observer should brace for, especially after the Citizens United decision, is that the Supreme Court could potentially eliminate ALL federal contribution limits. Indeed, note that the Republican National Committee joined the Alabama man on this court challenge. And as NBC&rsquo;s Kasie Hunt reports (more on this below), one of the RNC&rsquo;s recommendations after the GOP&rsquo;s losses in 2012 is giving the parties a bigger role in fundraising vs. outside groups &ndash; and one way to do this is to eliminate the contribution limits.</p>\n<p>*** <b>The more some things change, the more they stay the same</b>: On the one hand, the politics behind achieving immigration reform haven&rsquo;t been more promising as they are right now. Yesterday, we learned that President Obama called three of the four Republican senators working on a bipartisan effort to achieve comprehensive immigration (John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Marco Rubio). And Rubio&rsquo;s office issued an encouraging statement, especially after it had complained the Obama White House hadn&rsquo;t sought its input on reform. &quot;Sen. Rubio appreciated receiving President Obama\'s phone call to discuss immigration reform late tonight in Jerusalem,&quot; Rubio&rsquo;s spokesman said. &quot;The senator told the president that he feels good about the ongoing negotiations in the Senate.&quot; (Can&rsquo;t help but wonder how much of this is both sides doing what they have to do on the theatrics front.) On the other hand, it appears that the politics also haven&rsquo;t entirely changed since reform tanked in 2005-2007. Just see the reaction from McCain&rsquo;s two town halls yesterday in Arizona. The <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/free/20130219mccain-defends-immigration-plan-angry-residents.html">AP</a>: &ldquo;Some audience members shouted out their disapproval [at McCain&rsquo;s call for a legal path for illegal immigrants. &ldquo;One man yelled that only guns would discourage illegal immigration. Another man complained that illegal immigrants should never be able to become citizens or vote. A third man said illegal immigrants were illiterate invaders who wanted free government benefits.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>*** <b>On the gun debate and presidential leadership</b>: While the Obama White House has taken sort of a backseat in the immigration debate -- at least for now -- to let Congress work its will, it&rsquo;s striking to note the active role it has taken in the gun debate after Newtown. Ask yourself this question: Where would this issue be, even the chance at getting universal background checks, without the president putting his shoulder behind the issue. This is an example of why presidential leadership does matter in politics. The irony in all of this: Guns were never an issue Obama campaigned on during the 2012 election. Every two or three days, there&rsquo;s a new gun event being pushed by the White House. Yesterday, it was the Biden Facebook townhall, which gave social media its quote of the day: If you want to protect yourself, get a double-barrel shotgun,&rdquo; he said, per <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/news/biden_buy_shotguns_not_assault_weapons-222534-1.html?pos=htmbtxt">Roll Call</a>.</p>\n<p>*** <b>Frank Fahrenkopf sounds off</b>: Speaking of the 2012 election, don&rsquo;t miss one of the old-guard Republican establishment figures -- former RNC Chair Frank Fahrenkopf -- sounding off on his party, Washington, and the media during a talk in Las Vegas.

More: &ldquo;Fahrenkopf said the GOP should take the position that the country needs &lsquo;sensible, fair, immigration reform.&rsquo;&rdquo; And: &ldquo;Fahrenkopf couldn&rsquo;t resist a criticism of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie&rsquo;s embrace of Obama during Hurricane Sandy, providing this cringe-worthy description: &lsquo;He kissed him. He didn&rsquo;t have to French-kiss him. I think he went overboard.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>*** <b>Breaking down some of the RNC&rsquo;s recommendations after their 2012 losses</b>: Meanwhile, NBC&rsquo;s Kasie Hunt reports that Republican Party officials studying how to rebuild the party in the wake of 2012 losses are hoping to release their set of recommendations by mid-March -- and the list of fixes is already beginning to take shape. Some of these recommendations, per Hunt: 1) expanding the map and increasing voter contact; the party needs a plan that\'s not dissimilar to former DNC Chairman Howard Dean\'s 50-state strategy as it tries to expand the map beyond traditional red states; 2) changing campaign finance. The GOP team worries about how much new campaign finance law has weakened the national party structure, handing more power to outside groups on both sides of the aisle -- and giving a louder voice to both the left- and right-wing; and 3) limiting presidential primary debates.</p>\n<p>*** <b>All tied up in Virginia</b>: Finally, turning to this year&rsquo;s gubernatorial contest in Virginia, <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-centers/polling-institute/virginia/release-detail?ReleaseID=1852">a new Quinnipiac poll</a> finds the race is pretty much tied &ndash; whether or not GOP Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling decides to mount a third-party challenge.

And in a three-way race, it&rsquo;s McAuliffe at 34%, Cuccinelli at 31%, and Bolling at 13%. Folks, Bolling is polling at 13%, and he hasn&rsquo;t even announced. If he gets any kind of serious financial support, he can become a real threat. Do NOT take this candidacy lightly. This is not some spoiler in the works. Democrats shouldn&rsquo;t be rooting for Bolling to get in because they simply think he&rsquo;ll split GOPers and indies with Cuccinelli.

Sarah Helene Duggin from the Catholic University of America looks at potential foreign-born presidential candidates like Ted Cruz and a possible emerging consensus among scholars about their eligibility for the White House.\nThe 2016 presidential election is more than three years away, but potential candidates and their supporters are already contemplating the next campaign. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas—now well-known for his role in the recent federal shutdown—and California’s celebrity former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger are among those whose names are circulating. But neither Cruz nor Schwarzenegger was born in the United States, and the Constitution provides that “[n]o person except a natural born citizen, or a Citizen at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President.”\nFor Cruz, Schwarzenegger, and a number of other potential candidates, the Natural Born Citizenship Clause raises a critical question: Is anyone born outside the United States constitutionally eligible to serve as president?\nSenator John McCain, who was born in the Panama Canal Zone, faced the same question with respect to his natural-born citizenship status in his 2008 presidential bid, and purported concerns about President Obama’s constitutional qualifications led “birthers” to file lawsuits challenging his natural-born credentials on the basis of a variety of far-fetched theories during the last several years. A new natural-born citizenship debate is already simmering, and it seems likely to heat up a great deal before the 2016 election takes place.\nThe Constitution does not define the term natural born citizen. Even so, Governor Schwarzenegger is clearly out of the running. Given that he was born in Austria to Austrian parents, there is no basis for arguing that he is a natural-born citizen of the United States.\nFor Senator Cruz—who was born in Calgary, Alberta, to an American mother and a Cuban father—the question is more complicated. There is a strong argument that anyone who acquires United States citizenship at birth, whether by virtue of the 14th Amendment or by operation of federal statute, qualifies as natural born. The Supreme Court, however, has never ruled on the meaning of the natural-born citizenship requirement. In the absence of a definitive Supreme Court ruling—or a constitutional amendment—the parameters of the clause remain uncertain.

New NBC poll confirms an early reality check on 2016: 1) GOP remains divided… 2) Dem Party is pretty unified around Hillary Clinton… And 3) Democrats continue to benefit from the same demographic trends that helped Obama in ’08 and ’12… What’s more, the media (see the New Republic piece) appear more eager for a Dem challenger to Hillary than Democrats are (see our NBC poll)… Pro-Hillary Super PAC holds finance meeting in New York… WSJ: Fewer than 50,000 have enrolled in the federal health-care exchange… And Herring now leads Obenshain by a mere 117 votes in the VA AG race.\nHillary Clinton at the Pennsylvania Conference For Women in Philadelphia on Nov. 1, 2013.\n*** A reality check on 2016: Yes, it’s early. And yes, 2008 taught us that the early front-runners (Clinton and Giuliani) don’t always end up as the presidential nominees. But our new NBC News poll looking ahead to the 2016 presidential election reconfirms three current political realities. One, the Republican Party is divided. According to the poll, 32% of Republican and Republican-leaning respondents say they would vote for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in a GOP presidential primary, while 31% prefer another Republican candidate (never mind the other third who are undecided, so together 68% of GOPers are not on board with Christie). Two, the Democratic Party is pretty unified. By comparison in the poll, 66% of Democratic or Democratic-leaning respondents say they’d back Hillary Clinton in a presidential primary, versus just 14% who say they’d vote for another Democratic candidate (and 34% total who claim not to be for Hillary yet). And three, Democrats continue to benefit from demographic trends that will be difficult for the GOP to overcome in 2016 -- and beyond. In a hypothetical matchup between Clinton and Christie, the poll finds the former Democratic secretary of state getting the support of 44% of all adults, while the Republican governor gets 34%. You might not think you need a poll to tell you these things, but a poll certainly helps to reinforce them.\nRamesh Ponnuru and Ruth Marcus discuss a potential Hillary Clinton 2016 run against Rep. Gov. Chris Christie and whether Elizabeth Warren may enter the race.\n*** Christie vs. a generic Republican: As mentioned above, our poll shows Republicans split over Christie: 32% would back him in a GOP primary, versus 31% who would support another Republican candidate. And it’s instructive to study the crosstabs to see where Christie over-performs and under-performs here. He over-performs among women (35%), minorities (46%), seniors (48%), and people in the Northeast (57%) -- you know, the folks who don’t dominate Republican primaries! But he under-performs among men (28%); Republicans ages 18-29, a la the Rand Paul crowd (15%); upper-income Republicans (26%); and residents in the Midwest (30%), South (27%), and West (22%) – or the Republicans who DO DOMINATE Republican primaries. This geographical divide is especially striking -- 57% support in the Northeast, but just 27% in the South and 22% in the West.\n*** Clinton vs. a generic Democrat: It’s equally instructive to see where Clinton over-performs against another Democrat. She gets 70% among females, 70% among whites, 71% among seniors, 72% among the lowest-income Democrats, and 73% in the Northeast and 70% in the Midwest. Where she underperforms is among men (62%), college grads (62%), and 60% among upper-income Democrats – these are the remnants of Obama’s white coalition in the ’08 Democratic race. But a reality check here: She’s still getting SIXTY PERCENT among these folks, which suggests there isn’t really a substantial opening for another Democratic candidate (whether it’s Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, or anyone else). Remember, in 2005, there was some real Clinton fatigue among Democrats that provided the opening for Obama. That’s not the evidence right now.\n*** Demography continues to be destiny: As for our hypothetical general-election matchup between Clinton and Christie, Hillary is benefitting from the same demographic trends that helped President Obama win election in 2008 and re-election in 2012. She leads Christie among African Americans (83%-4%), respondents ages 18 to 29 (45%-31%), and Latinos (44%-33%). Clinton also holds the advantage with residents from the Northeast (52%-35%), West (43%-30%), the South (43%-35%) and Midwest (41%-37%). And she has a narrow edge among independents (39%-35%). Christie, meanwhile, leads among whites (41%-37%), seniors (44%-41%), and respondents with the highest incomes (46%-34%). Just what Republicans want to hear: They are the part of old rich white people? (By the way, see today’s new L.A. Times poll of Californians, which should be a wakeup call to GOP officials nationally.) Folks, these numbers are pretty similar to the splits we saw between Obama and Romney in 2012. And the downside of being the ELECTABILITY candidate for Republicans? You better be leading (or close to it) against Clinton, and you better be performing better among particular demographic groups than Romney did. Right now, Christie isn’t doing either.\n*** Press appears to be more eager for a Dem challenger to Hillary than Democrats are: The political story that went viral yesterday was the New Republic piece on Elizabeth Warren and whether she might challenge Hillary Clinton in 2016 -- despite Hillary’s numbers we mentioned above. From the article: “In addition to being strongly identified with the party’s populist wing, any candidate who challenged Clinton would need several key assets. The candidate would almost certainly have to be a woman, given Democrats’ desire to make history again. She would have to amass huge piles of money with relatively little effort. Above all, she would have to awaken in Democratic voters an almost evangelical passion. As it happens, there is precisely such a person. Her name is Elizabeth Warren.” But here is the potential danger for Clinton: The political press corps appears to be MORE EAGER to search for a challenger for Clinton than Democrats are -- just see our poll.\n*** About that pro-Hillary Super PAC: There’s one more piece of 2016 news worth mentioning today. “On Tuesday, [former Obama top aide Mitch] Stewart and a dozen or so other political operatives and 170 donors will gather in New York to plot how to help Mrs. Clinton win in 2016. The meeting is the first national finance council strategy meeting of Ready for Hillary, a ‘super PAC’ devoted to building a network to support Mrs. Clinton’s potential presidential ambitions,” the New York Times writes. Folks, it will be interesting to look through the Ready for Hillary FEC report when it comes out. Which consultants are making money?\n*** Paper: Fewer than 50,000 have enrolled in the federal exchange: Turning from 2016 to the troubled Obamacare rollout, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that fewer than 50,000 people “had successfully navigated the troubled federal health-care website and enrolled in private insurance plans as of last week, two people familiar with the matter said, citing internal government data. The figure is a fraction of the Obama administration\'s target of 500,000 enrollees for October.” But three caveats worth noting: 1) the 50,000 figure doesn’t include those who signed up via the better-running state websites, 2) it doesn’t include those who received insurance via expanded Medicaid, and 3) the administration always assumed most people would purchase their insurance in December, given that the insurance doesn’t take effect until Jan. 1. And the fact that the federal exchange is behind schedule shouldn’t surprise anyone. The website, after all, hasn’t been working. As one health insurer told the Journal: "Given the problems we have witnessed and experienced, that [40,000 to 50,000] number is actually higher than I expected."\n*** Herring now leads Obenshain in the VA AG race by 117 votes: And lastly, in the final undecided race from Election Day 2013, it appears that Democrat Mark Herring has taken the lead over Republican Mark Obenshain in Virginia’s thisclose race for attorney general. The Washington Post: “Herring had started the day trailing his Republican opponent … by a mere 17 votes out of 2.2 million cast. But as jurisdictions across the state continued to scrub their vote counts, the State Board of Elections showed Herring with a 117-vote lead late Monday.” More from the Post: “Local jurisdictions have until Tuesday at 6 p.m. to report their results to the State Board of Elections. The state then is scheduled to certify the results on Nov. 25. If the margin is less than 1 percent, either candidate can request a recount. If the margin is less than 0.5 percent, the state will pay for the recount.” And it certainly looks like we’re headed for a recount.\nClick here to sign up for First Read emails.\nText FIRST to 622639, to sign up for First Read alerts to your mobile phone.\nCheck us out on Facebook and also on Twitter.

The Arizona Republic isn\'t too pleased about the Supreme Court\'s ruling on Arizona\'s draconian proof-of-citizenship law:\nArizona’s proof-of-citizenship requirement was an unnecessary political gambit that suppressed the vote.\nBut the court did not strike down Arizona’s law. The ruling applies only to federal forms and elections. The state can continue to impose the proof-of-citizenship rule for state registrations.\nWhat’s more, Scalia outlined how Arizona could seek federal approval to apply the proof-of-citizenship requirement to federal registration forms, as well.\nArizona Secretary of State Ken Bennett said he intends to follow Scalia’s guidelines.\nLet’s be clear: The integrity of elections is of paramount importance. But there was little evidence of voter fraud before Prop. 200. It was part of a backlash against illegal immigration that tapped into raw emotion without stopping to engage analytical thought processes.\nUndocumented immigrants were not hijacking elections. They were busing tables.\nSo, let’s be even more clear: Participation in elections is also of paramount importance, and Prop. 200 hurt that.\nThe Supreme Court would have done the state a favor by sweeping away the law.\nMore analysis from The New York Times:\nThe Supreme Court, in a 7-to-2 ruling on Monday, strongly affirmed the power of Congress to regulate Congressional elections. The court held that Arizona cannot impose a requirement on voters to prove their citizenship when the federal law, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, does not require any such thing. [...]\nWhile the decision was emphatic about federal authority over the manner of elections, the Scalia opinion also said that states have power to set the qualifications of voters, like residency requirements, and to enforce them. Justice Scalia wrote that Arizona could still ask the federal agency responsible for administering this federal law to permit the state to require proof of citizenship. And he said that if the agency did not grant the request, the state could ask a federal court to decide that signing the federal form is not enough to ensure that a would-be voter is actually a citizen.\nIn leaving open an avenue for an Arizona challenge, the court also made it clear that ensuring voting rights to every eligible American requires continued vigilance.\nThe Washington Post:\nIf Arizona doesn’t like how the feds are applying that clause, the state can take them to court. Arizona, however, has not pressed its case through the channels available to accommodate its interests in regulating voter qualifications.\nAnd Arizona shouldn’t. The prospect of voter fraud should not be dismissed, but there is no evidence that it poses a practical problem. There is a far greater danger in limiting access to the ballot box, a sacrosanct right in America. Neither the states nor the federal government should be imposing new restrictions on the franchise. They should instead enact universal voter registration laws and other reforms to expand access to the vote.\nFor more on the day\'s top stories, head below the fold.\nGeorge Skelton at The Los Angeles Times argues that we need to regulate bullet purchases in addition to gun purchases:\nFrom what I\'ve been reading, the Santa Monica killer was packing an illegal assault rifle and 40 high-capacity ammunition magazines. He sprayed 100 bullets and had access to 1,300. And, oh yes, he was a mental case. The guy\'s exact background and how he obtained his war-ready arsenal weren\'t clear as of this writing. [...]\nGuns don\'t kill people. Bullets do.\nWe regulate firearms," says Garen Wintemute, director of the UC Davis Violence Prevention Research Program. "Firearms are nothing more than bullet delivery devices. If we\'re going to regulate the delivery device, we should regulate the bullet that the device delivers." Such a bill recently passed the state Senate and is pending in the Assembly. [...]\nOn the debate about Edward Snowden, David Firestone at The New York Times examines Snowden\'s latest leaks and argues that they\'ve taken a "questionable turn":\nMr. Snowden’s actions, though illegal, exposed programs that many people, including lawmakers of both parties, believed had gone too far. The leaks showed how the intelligence community had used the cover of secrecy to expand and abuse its domestic surveillance powers, surprising even people who had written the post-9/11 laws on which these powers were supposed to be based. They have spurred a useful and important debate on whether those laws should be changed.\nIn the last few days, however, Mr. Snowden’s leaks have taken a questionable turn. He told the South China Morning Post that the United States had hacked into many Chinese computer systems, including those at universities and businesses. And yesterday he showed documents to the Guardian revealing that the N.S.A. and its British counterpart had spied on politicians from around the world who attended the 2009 G-20 summit in London.\nThese documents are of a different and more dubious order than the first ones. Like all leaks, their benefits have to be weighed against their potential harm, and in this case, it’s difficult to see what the benefits are.\nMeanwhile, The Denver Post\'s Alicia Caldwell pens a piece on overreach in the aftermath of 9/11 and a new bill aimed to improve the situation:\nHistory may be a harsh judge of the way this country has compromised civil liberties and expanded executive power in the fearful days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\nAt least I hope it will.\nBecause if it doesn\'t, we will have accepted a new normal in which it\'s all right for the government to routinely get secret orders in a non-adversarial court to vacuum up vast stores of information about our lives. [...]\nThis weekend, Colorado\'s Sen. Mark Udall appeared on "Meet The Press" and made an important point when he said: "It doesn\'t have to be all or nothing."\nHe\'s right. It\'s time to push back on some of the powers ceded to the executive branch in the Patriot Act and its subsequent revisions. Udall is not talking about gutting the Patriot Act or anything even close, and neither am I.\nA bill that Udall is proposing with Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden would beef up a generic relevancy test the court has established for government acquisition of "business records." Those business records include phone call metadata — that\'s a highly revealing compilation of times, places and participants in phone calls, but not the content of the call.\n[UPDATE]: Our very own Greg Dworkin has a must-read piece on the six-month anniversary of the tragedy in Newtown:\nThe Institute of Medicine estimates that there were 105,000 gun related injuries or deaths in 2010, with deaths estimated at a third of that total. With children, there are twice as many homicides as suicides; that\'s reversed for adults.\nGun deaths, whether accidental or intentional in children, are a leading cause of death. In theory, these are preventable deaths.\nSince the Newtown tragedy, federal attempts to pass background failed their first attempt in the Senate, but by all accounts will be back for another vote. In any case, that\'s not the only endeavor underway.

Colorado Secretary of State Scott Gessler (R), currently seen as a serious challenger to Gov. Hickenlooper, has been on a crusade to end the plague of fraudulent voting by noncitizens.\nToday's Denver Post reports that Gessler had given Boulder County DA Stan Garnett a list of 17 noncitizens voting in Boulder County. But yesterday,\n... Garnett's office found that all 17 people were citizens and were able to easily verify their status ...\nSo. Final results of Gessler's investigation for Boulder county? That would be ...\nZERO.\nThe Post article concludes:\nA spokesman for the Secretary of State's Office said Gessler is trying to address the matter in a methodical way while Garnett is trying to score partisan points.\n;-)

This week\'s Time magazine front cover with Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, is titled "The elephant in the room". He told ABC: "If I\'m bothered by jokes about my weight, it\'s time for me to curl up into the foetal position and go home, OK?"\n"So let\'s get the fat jokes out of the way first. Christie is a big figure, a heavy hitter and a weighty presence," his campaign manager and friend of 20 years Bill Palatucci tells me.\n"It certainly doesn\'t bother anyone in New Jersey, we all have our struggles. He\'s got a bit of a weight problem, but it doesn\'t hold him down whatsoever."\nWhat is important is the big guy\'s next trick, which requires all the poise of a tightrope walker, balancing on the taut wire stretching between popular appeal and conservative distaste.\nLiberal vote\nMake no mistake - he could be, puns aside, a huge player. He could be the Republicans\' best stab at the White House in 2016, potentially transforming his party in the process.\nHe has, as far as I can see, a unique appeal in American politics, reaching parts that Hillary Clinton can\'t.\nRush Limbaugh, the hyper-conservative, Tea Party-adored doyen of right-wing talk show hosts, says it tells you all you need to know that Democrats love Christie, that he is a creation of the liberal media.\nHe has a point, although not the one he thinks he is making.\nChristie\'s importance is precisely because a third of self-identified Democrats who voted in New Jersey vote for him. It is because liberals in the Washington media establishment can vaguely imagine holding their ideological noses and voting for him.\nHurricane Sandy defined Chris Christie - he toured his smashed-up state, throwing his big arms around the newly homeless.\nHe also gripped the hand of President Obama, praising him for helping the rescue operation with government money - this, just days before last year\'s election.\nIt disgusted some conservatives. He looked like a man more concerned about helping people than remaining pure to a cause.\nHe talks of getting the job done and working together at a time Washington can do neither, mainly because of the shenanigans of his own party.\nBut a lot of Americans like this sort of talk - you might even remember the senator who said there was not a liberal America, or a conservative America but the United States of America.\nIt can be the key to the White House.\nParty label\nThere are two main ways to win elections (they are not mutually exclusive).\nOne, you can motivate and organise and drag out all the people who, in theory, like your party and should be voting for you. This is what Obama did in 2008 and 2012.\nSecond, you can hoover up the swing voters, the people in the centre and some of those who often vote for the other party.\nIt is a typical mistake of both politicians and journalists to talk in shorthand implying everyone is born with a party label around their necks.\nIt is not true. Even in the extraordinarily partisan world of US politics there are plenty of people who change from one election to another or split the ticket, voting say one way for the Senate, the other for the president.\nHere\'s the thing - although the Democrat nomination is Hillary Clinton\'s for the taking, she can\'t necessarily pull off this trick.\nMany Republicans heartily dislike the Clintons, and her appeal to the centre is uncertain.\nNew Jersey exit polls indicated voters preferred Hillary Clinton by 49% to Christie\'s 43%. That\'s not bad in a long-time Democrat state.\nBut to get a shot at the general election, Christie has to win his own party\'s nomination first.\nThat will be really hard - in 2012, the Republican candidates tried to outdo each other by appealing to the right, and as a result Mitt Romney found himself trapped inside an ideological bubble of his own design, unable to appeal to his natural constituency of business-minded moderates.\nConservatives\nChristie may be pugnacious on low taxation and the unions, but he has already evoked conservatives\' ire. He will have trouble convincing them he\'s the real deal.\nOn the Sunday shows, he tried a combination of "Let\'s work together" and "I\'m just the governor of New Jersey", but I\'d expect him now to trim to the right to an extent.\nI asked his old friend Bill Palatucci what he made of the Tea Party criticisms.\nHe said: "There are lots of elements of the Tea Party. The governor has great, great support in New Jersey for cutting taxes and making government smaller. Our spending in New Jersey in 2014 is less than in 2008.\n"I think the Tea Party is about freedom and smaller government and the governor is about the same things."\nSo he can appeal to conservatives? I ask.\n"Absolutely. The governor is very much a conservative, very much pro-life, against gay marriage, worked very hard to get Mitt Romney elected.\n"His accomplishments on fiscal issues when the state was on the brink of bankruptcy, turning that around - that\'s a record many conservatives like."\nBut Christie has ducked and weaved along the centre line.\nHe\'s long been anti-abortion, but hasn\'t made a big deal of it; he\'s opposed gay marriage but recently ordered New Jersey courts to drop an appeal against it; and he\'s banned conversion therapy for gay kids in New Jersey.\nSo I ask - will he stand for president?\nBill Palatucci laughs long and hard. "We\'ll wait and see," he says. "He\'s just got re-elected so it\'s important to get to the job of the second term, a good second term."\nThat indeed may be critical - New Jersey\'s economy is not in a great way.\nBut for the next three years, Christie will be on the tightrope - how he sways and if he falls will be vitally important for his party and the country.

From Lone Star Project:\nEarlier today (Wednesday), the three-judge Federal District Court in San Antonio handling the Texas redistricting litigation entered a final judgment in the Texas State Senate redistricting law suit. In its ruling, the Court made clear that Wendy Davis and her fellow plaintiffs in the case won and Greg Abbott, representing the Republican state leadership, lost.\nGreg Abbott served as the primary legal counsel to the State of Texas during the consideration of redistricting by the Legislature and defended the State’s redistricting plans in federal court. His efforts in redistricting have been nothing short of an embarrassing debacle.\nAbbott advised the Legislature to configure and adopt redistricting plans that the federal courts ruled to be in violation of the US Voting Rights Act. Two of the three redistricting plans were ruled to be drawn with discriminatory intent. Abbott has spent millions of dollars in Texas taxpayer funds to unsuccessfully defend redistricting plans that were unfair and illegal. Abbott’s actions go beyond partisanship to illustrate profound incompetence and open hostility to Hispanics, African Americans and other fair-minded Texans.\nhttp://lonestarproject.net/...\nHere is the entire court order:\nWENDY DAVIS; MARC VEASEY; ROY BROOKS; VICKY BARGAS; PAT PANGBURN; FRANCES DELEON; DOROTHY DEBOSE; and SARAH JOYNER\nPlaintiffs\nRICK PERRY, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Texas;\nJOHN STEEN, in his official capacity as Secretary of State of the State of Texas;\nBOYD RICHIE, in his official capacity as Chair of the Texas Democratic Party;\nand STEVE MUNISTERI, in his official capacity as Chair of the Republican Party of Texas.\nDefendants\nFINAL JUDGMENT\nThis Court previously ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED:\nthat Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief was granted to the extent that Senate plan S100, the benchmark plan, violates the one-person, one-vote requirements of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and will not be used for any further elections;\nthat Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief was granted such that Senate plan S148, the 2011 enacted plan, has been permanently enjoined from implementation and no elections have been or will be held thereunder; and\nthat Plan S172, which was reviewed under the standard set forth in Perry v. Perez and restored district 10 to near benchmark configuration and remedied the constitutional infirmities being asserted by Plaintiffs, was to be used for the 2012 election.\nIt is further ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED:\nthat because (1) Plan S148 has been repealed, (2) Plaintiffs agree that Plan S172 does not violate the Voting Rights Act or the Constitution, and (3) Plaintiffs do not seek any further relief with regard to Plan S148, Plaintiffs’ remaining claims under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution are DISMISSED AS MOOT; and\nthat, as prevailing parties, Plaintiffs are awarded their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.\nPursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2) and W.D. Tex. Rule CV-7(j), Plaintiffs may file their applications for attorneys’ fees and costs no later than twenty days after entry of judgment. If the application is opposed in whole or in part, a response in opposition shall be filed no later than ten days after the filing of the application.\nSIGNED AND ENTERED this 4th day of September, 2013.\nhttp://lonestarproject.net/...\nIt sounds like Goposaur Abbott was trying to implement the discriminatory redistricting plan DESPITE it's already having been ruled illegal. That should be a crime in and of itself. Disgusting.\nSen. Davis, who heroically filibustered Texas' draconian abortion bill back in June, is looking more and more like a viable candidate for Texas governor. If I lived there, she would have my vote.\n___\nP.S. Condolences to Sen. Wendy Davis, whose father passed away this morning.\nhttp://www.wfaa.com/...

A 90 year old man who just happens to be the former Speaker of the US House was denied a voter ID according to Texas\'s new voter ID requirements.\nFORT WORTH — Former House Speaker Jim Wright was denied a voter ID card Saturday at a Texas Department of Public Safety office.\n“Nobody was ugly to us, but they insisted that they wouldn’t give me an ID,” Wright said.\nThe legendary Texas political figure says that he has worked things out with DPS and that he will get a state-issued personal identification card in time for him to vote Tuesday in the state and local elections.\nBecause a 90 year old man is trying to game the system, right?\nBut here is the real problem:\nBut after the difficulty he had this weekend getting a proper ID card, Wright, 90, expressed concern that such problems could deter others from voting and stifle turnout. After spending much of his life fighting to make it easier to vote, the Democratic Party icon said he is troubled by what he’s seeing happen under the state’s new voter ID law.\n“I earnestly hope these unduly stringent requirements on voters won’t dramatically reduce the number of people who vote,” Wright told the Star-Telegram. “I think they will reduce the number to some extent.”\nWright and his assistant, Norma Ritchson, went to the DPS office on Woodway Drive to get a State of Texas Election Identification Certificate. Wright said he realized earlier in the week that the photo identifications he had — a Texas driver’s license that expired in 2010 and a TCU faculty ID — do not satisfy requirements of the voter ID law, enacted in 2011 by the Legislature. DPS officials concurred.\nNot everyone will have the resources, or knowledge, that Wright has to overcome these obstacles. And Wright puts it very well:\nWe want to make sure that every eligible Texan who wants to cast a ballot can,” Pierce said. “We want to help any Texan who needs additional information."\nWright, who said he has voted in every election since 1944, lamented that such help is called for.\n“From my youth I have tried to expand the elections,” Wright said. “I pushed to abolish the poll tax. I was the first to come out for lowering the voting age to 18.”\nThe state put up these obstacles in the first place- now they are \'concerned\' to make sure everyone can overcome them. They have \'solved\' non-existent voter fraud problems by creating actual problems.\nFor more information, voters may call the Texas secretary of state\'s office at 800-252-VOTE (8683) or the Tarrant County Elections Office at 817-831-VOTE (8683). Go online for more information at www.tarrantcounty.com/evote or votexas.org.\nI was hoping to let people know who were commenting on the Jim Wright article, and having problems establishing id requirements for elderly relatives to tell them the following: A group of nonprofits put together a great help site that will walk you through all the requirements step by step, and have active links to the agencies/sites necessary to make corrections. It\'s Got ID Texas? www.gotidtexas.org. If someone else would post this info until my problem is resolved, that would be great. Thanks!

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court rebuffed the state of Alabama on Monday by deciding not to intervene in a case where federal judges blocked a state law that criminalizes the harboring of illegal immigrants.\nBy refusing to hear Alabama’s appeal of the Obama administration’s lower court victories, the justices steered clear of a hot-button debate at a time when Congress is engaged in writing legislation to overhaul immigration laws.\nBoth a federal judge and an appeals court agreed with the White House that federal law trumped a provision in Alabama state law that made it illegal to harbor or transport anyone in the state who had entered the country illegally.\nThe appeals court ruling remains intact as a result of the Supreme Court’s refusal to intervene. A brief order issued by the Supreme Court on Monday said Justice Antonin Scalia disagreed with the decision not to hear the case.\nThe case before the court concerned only the harboring provision. Other parts of the Alabama law are being challenged also by the Obama administration and private groups.\nEnacted in 2011, the Alabama law is considered one of the toughest state immigration statutes in the country. The law also made it illegal to encourage people to either enter or stay in the state in violation of federal immigration laws.\nIn two separate decisions, the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld injunctions against the harboring provision and other parts of the law in August 2012.\nAlthough the high court declined to hear the case, the same issue could resurface in the high court because nine other states have similar laws that have been challenged. Often the court will wait until several different lower courts have ruled on a legal issue before providing the final word.\n“Hopefully, Justice Scalia’s vote indicates that once those additional courts have weighed in, the Supreme Court will be willing to grant review,” said Joy Patterson, a spokeswoman for Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange.\nThe Alabama case will now return to the district court, where the judge will, among other things, consider the impact of a Supreme Court ruling last year in which the justices partially upheld Arizona’s similar immigration law, Patterson added.\nA separate challenge to the Alabama law brought by private groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, will also proceed in the district court.\nCecillia Wang, an ACLU attorney, said the aim will be to prove that parts of the law that were not already blocked “are in fact causing constitutional violations.”\nThe case is Alabama v. United States, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 12-884.

" href="http://voteyestn.org/">Yes on 1</a>&quot; campaign with a reception and dinner. The campaign has just hired an experienced political fundraiser and a veteran campaign manager and expects to raise more than $250,000 at the kickoff event.</p>\n<p>&quot;Now that our time has come, we\'re not going to take anything for granted,&quot; said Brian Harris, president of <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="http://www.tennesseerighttolife.org/">Tennessee Right to Life</a>, which worked for more than a decade to get the measure on the 2014 ballot. &quot;We\'re going to do the utmost to see that this amendment is passed.&quot;</p>\n<p>The preparation over Amendment 1 in Tennessee comes as a recent Texas abortion ruling could lead to a national fight in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. Texas\' new law -- which went into effect Friday -- is one of the nation\'s most restrictive abortion laws.</p>\n<p>It will be up to Tennessee voters to decide whether the state\'s constitution will, for the first time, specifically address abortion. The referendum would add this language: &quot;Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion.&quot;</p>\n<p>The wording could pave the way for lawmakers to enact abortion restrictions that have been previously ruled out of bounds under the constitution\'s strong privacy protections.</p>\n<p>&quot;I think it\'s going to be a fight, that\'s for sure,&quot; said Jeff Teague, the president of <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/mid-east-tennesee/">Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee</a>, one of the chief organizers of the yet-to-be-launched campaign against the measure. &quot;The fact that the other side is already kicking off their effort so early is a (recognition) on their part (that) it\'s going to be a fight.&quot;</p>\n<aside><p>&ldquo;Now that our time has come, we\'re not going to take anything for granted. We\'re going to do the utmost to see that this amendment is passed.&rdquo;</p>Brian Harris, president of Tennessee Right to Life</aside>\n<p>The effort to defeat the measure, however, has not been dormant. Planned Parenthood affiliates in Tennessee and the American Civil Liberties Union have conducted polling and focus groups, secured commitments for donations and begun working with local and national groups to get organized and develop a plan.</p>\n<p>The two groups were behind the original lawsuit challenging abortion regulations in Tennessee in the 1990s. At the time, Tennessee had some of the strictest abortion rules in the country. They included a requirement that doctors use materials created by the state to counsel women seeking abortions, a mandatory two-day waiting period after the counseling and a requirement that second-trimester abortions be performed in hospitals rather than outpatient clinics.</p>\n<p>In 2000, the Tennessee Supreme Court struck down those regulations and ruled that women have a fundamental right to abortion in Tennessee.</p>\n<p>&quot;A woman\'s right to terminate her pregnancy is a vital part of the right to privacy guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution,&quot; the opinion said.</p>\n<p><b>Trenches set up</b></p>\n<p>Proponents view the upcoming year as critical to defending those hard-won abortion rights.</p>\n<p>&quot;The clear goal of this ballot initiative is to make abortion difficult to access or unavailable in Tennessee,&quot; said Hedy Weinberg, executive director of ACLU Tennessee. &quot;We\'re confident when the public understands what this ballot initiative is about, they will vote no. Tennesseans want their privacy and understand that this ballot initiative takes away that privacy.&quot;</p>\n<p>Since the state Supreme Court decision, those who oppose abortion have been working to get the proposed amendment before voters. To get a referendum on the state ballot, the groups first had to wait until the Legislature had enough supportive lawmakers in office.Then, according to state rules, the measure had to be approved twice in separate years, which eventually happened in 2009 and 2011.</p>\n<aside><p>&ldquo;The clear goal of this ballot initiative is to make abortion difficult to access or unavailable in Tennessee. &rdquo;</p>Hedy Weinberg, executive director of ACLU Tennessee</aside>\n<p>Jim Bob Duggar and his family &mdash; stars of the reality TLC network program <i>19 Kids and Counting </i>&mdash; will perform a concert, sign books and speak about their support of Amendment 1 when they visit Cornerstone Church in Madison. Joining them will be Alveda King, niece of the late Martin Luther King Jr., an outspoken opponent of abortion.</p>\n<p>&quot;I really believe a lot of Christians have sat on the sidelines and not gotten involved in politics in the past and not bothered to vote,&quot; said Duggar, a former Arkansas state representative. &quot;There is a whole sleeping giant of Christians out there. A lot of people in Tennessee don\'t realize that because of the Supreme Court decision back in 2000, they wiped out almost every regulation and state law that regulated abortions.&quot;</p>\n<p><b><b>Tennessee\'s power debated</b></b></p>\n<p>That message &mdash; that Tennessee lawmakers lack the ability to regulate abortion &mdash; is disputed by abortion rights advocates, who point to a series of existing state abortion restrictions.</p>\n<p>Among them: Tennessee requires minors to obtain the consent of one parent before having an abortion and requires abortion clinic waiting rooms to post signs &quot;in 40 pt. Arial font&quot; informing patients that it is illegal for anyone to coerce a woman into an abortion. Last year, lawmakers passed the &quot;Life Defense Act of 2012,&quot; which requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital &mdash; a law that one Knoxville, Tenn., abortion clinic cited as forcing its closure. In addition, Tennessee halted funding for Planned Parenthood last year, redirecting it to other clinics.</p>\n<p>&quot;It\'s just false to say our legislature cannot pass laws,&quot; Weinberg said. &quot;It\'s misleading and not true. Proponents of the amendment have attempted to hide the true nature of this initiative by couching it in language, saying there are no state laws regulating abortion when the reality is the Tennessee Legislature is able to pass legislation as they have for some years, and right now there are numerous laws on the books regulating abortion in Tennessee.&quot;</p>\n<p><b><b>An open invitation?</b></b></p>\n<p>While abortion restrictions do exist, the Tennessee constitution bars other laws that neighboring states have enacted, including waiting periods, bans on later trimester abortions and required ultrasounds.</p>\n<p>Those added restrictions have led more women from other states to come to Tennessee to have abortions, a Tennessean special report in May 2012 found. More than 1 in 4 abortions in Tennessee were sought by women from out of state, according to an analysis of abortion data.</p>\n<p>Opponents of abortion say that voters don\'t want Tennessee to be known for its lack of abortion regulations.

The proposed constitutional amendment would give lawmakers more authority to regulate and restrict abortions.\nAt a separate event Monday night, Tennessee Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey, a Republican from Blountville, will launch the "Yes on 1" campaign with a reception and dinner. The campaign has just hired an experienced political fundraiser and a veteran campaign manager and expects to raise more than $250,000 at the kickoff event.\n"Now that our time has come, we\'re not going to take anything for granted," said Brian Harris, president of Tennessee Right to Life, which worked for more than a decade to get the measure on the 2014 ballot. "We\'re going to do the utmost to see that this amendment is passed."\nThe preparation over Amendment 1 in Tennessee comes as a recent Texas abortion ruling could lead to a national fight in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. Texas\' new law -- which went into effect Friday -- is one of the nation\'s most restrictive abortion laws.\nIt will be up to Tennessee voters to decide whether the state\'s constitution will, for the first time, specifically address abortion. The referendum would add this language: "Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion."\nThe wording could pave the way for lawmakers to enact abortion restrictions that have been previously ruled out of bounds under the constitution\'s strong privacy protections.\n"I think it\'s going to be a fight, that\'s for sure," said Jeff Teague, the president of Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee, one of the chief organizers of the yet-to-be-launched campaign against the measure. "The fact that the other side is already kicking off their effort so early is a (recognition) on their part (that) it\'s going to be a fight."\n“Now that our time has come, we\'re not going to take anything for granted. We\'re going to do the utmost to see that this amendment is passed.”\nBrian Harris, president of Tennessee Right to Life\nThe effort to defeat the measure, however, has not been dormant. Planned Parenthood affiliates in Tennessee and the American Civil Liberties Union have conducted polling and focus groups, secured commitments for donations and begun working with local and national groups to get organized and develop a plan.\nThe two groups were behind the original lawsuit challenging abortion regulations in Tennessee in the 1990s. At the time, Tennessee had some of the strictest abortion rules in the country. They included a requirement that doctors use materials created by the state to counsel women seeking abortions, a mandatory two-day waiting period after the counseling and a requirement that second-trimester abortions be performed in hospitals rather than outpatient clinics.\nIn 2000, the Tennessee Supreme Court struck down those regulations and ruled that women have a fundamental right to abortion in Tennessee.\n"A woman\'s right to terminate her pregnancy is a vital part of the right to privacy guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution," the opinion said.\nTrenches set up\nProponents view the upcoming year as critical to defending those hard-won abortion rights.\n"The clear goal of this ballot initiative is to make abortion difficult to access or unavailable in Tennessee," said Hedy Weinberg, executive director of ACLU Tennessee. "We\'re confident when the public understands what this ballot initiative is about, they will vote no. Tennesseans want their privacy and understand that this ballot initiative takes away that privacy."\nSince the state Supreme Court decision, those who oppose abortion have been working to get the proposed amendment before voters. To get a referendum on the state ballot, the groups first had to wait until the Legislature had enough supportive lawmakers in office.Then, according to state rules, the measure had to be approved twice in separate years, which eventually happened in 2009 and 2011.\n“The clear goal of this ballot initiative is to make abortion difficult to access or unavailable in Tennessee. ”\nHedy Weinberg, executive director of ACLU Tennessee\nJim Bob Duggar and his family — stars of the reality TLC network program 19 Kids and Counting — will perform a concert, sign books and speak about their support of Amendment 1 when they visit Cornerstone Church in Madison. Joining them will be Alveda King, niece of the late Martin Luther King Jr., an outspoken opponent of abortion.\n"I really believe a lot of Christians have sat on the sidelines and not gotten involved in politics in the past and not bothered to vote," said Duggar, a former Arkansas state representative. "There is a whole sleeping giant of Christians out there. A lot of people in Tennessee don\'t realize that because of the Supreme Court decision back in 2000, they wiped out almost every regulation and state law that regulated abortions."\nTennessee\'s power debated\nThat message — that Tennessee lawmakers lack the ability to regulate abortion — is disputed by abortion rights advocates, who point to a series of existing state abortion restrictions.\nAmong them: Tennessee requires minors to obtain the consent of one parent before having an abortion and requires abortion clinic waiting rooms to post signs "in 40 pt. Arial font" informing patients that it is illegal for anyone to coerce a woman into an abortion. Last year, lawmakers passed the "Life Defense Act of 2012," which requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital — a law that one Knoxville, Tenn., abortion clinic cited as forcing its closure. In addition, Tennessee halted funding for Planned Parenthood last year, redirecting it to other clinics.\n"It\'s just false to say our legislature cannot pass laws," Weinberg said. "It\'s misleading and not true. Proponents of the amendment have attempted to hide the true nature of this initiative by couching it in language, saying there are no state laws regulating abortion when the reality is the Tennessee Legislature is able to pass legislation as they have for some years, and right now there are numerous laws on the books regulating abortion in Tennessee."\nAn open invitation?\nWhile abortion restrictions do exist, the Tennessee constitution bars other laws that neighboring states have enacted, including waiting periods, bans on later trimester abortions and required ultrasounds.\nThose added restrictions have led more women from other states to come to Tennessee to have abortions, a Tennessean special report in May 2012 found. More than 1 in 4 abortions in Tennessee were sought by women from out of state, according to an analysis of abortion data.\nOpponents of abortion say that voters don\'t want Tennessee to be known for its lack of abortion regulations. The Yes on 1 campaign website posts a large illustration of a highway welcome sign with the words "The Volunteer State welcomes you" inside the state map. Underneath, it says "an abortion destination?"\nText of Amendment 1\n"Nothing in this Constitution secures or protects a right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion. The people retain the right through their elected state representatives and state senators to enact, amend, or repeal statutes regarding abortion, including, but not limited to, circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or when necessary to save the life of the mother."

CBS News via AP\nStephen Glass, a former writer for The New Republic, in a video frame grab released by CBS\'s "60 Minutes," in 2003.\nSAN FRANCISCO — Stephen Glass, one of the most infamous fabricators in modern U.S. journalism, faced a hostile California Supreme Court on Wednesday in his quest to demonstrate that he is a changed man with the moral fiber needed for admission to the state bar.\nGlass was a magazine journalism phenomenon in the late 1990s whose stories appeared in publications including Rolling Stone, Harper\'s and The New Republic. Eventually, Glass acknowledged that 42 articles were partly or wholly fabricated, according to a filing prepared by Glass\'s attorneys.\nAfter his journalism career ended, Glass attended law school and applied to the California State Bar. The Committee on Bar Examiners, which requires that applicants "receive a positive moral character determination," rejected his application. Glass then appealed to a special court, which granted the admission request.\nThe Committee on Bar Examiners challenged that ruling, and the California Supreme Court agreed to review it.\nAt a hearing Wednesday in Sacramento, Glass\'s attorney, Jon Eisenberg, argued that Glass had reformed, undergone extensive psychotherapy and gained the trust of his co-workers.\n"The question is, is he a liar today?" Eisenberg said. "The record demonstrates, as well as any record can demonstrate, that he is not a liar today."\nEisenberg faced skeptical questions from every justice on the seven-member court. Justice Carol Corrigan said Glass has not performed the kind of charitable good works that demonstrate strong character, which people making far less money than Glass do all the time.\n"They say character is what you do when no one is looking," Corrigan said, adding that Glass\'s track record on that score has been "abysmal."\nGlass\'s journalism career came crashing down in 1998 when one of his editors received a tip that a story was a fabrication.\n"Glass invented sources, events and organizations. He concocted quotes," his attorneys acknowledged in a court filing. "On several occasions he told mean-spirited and hurtful lies about real people."\nGlass wrote a fictionalized account of the events in the book "The Fabulist," and the movie "Shattered Glass" was based on his experience. In court Wednesday, Justice Ming Chin noted that Glass had received a sizeable retainer for the book, as well as salary for the magazine pieces he fabricated.\n"Did he repay any of that salary?" Chin asked.\n"Absolutely not. Not a penny," replied Rachel Grunberg, an attorney for the Committee of Bar Examiners.\nGlass submitted testimony from lawyers, judges and others attesting to his honest nature, including Martin Peretz, who edited The New Republic at the time of Glass\'s fabrications.\nBut California bar examiners believe Glass shows contrition only when it suits him. Glass compiled a full list of his fabrications only when he was trying to gain admittance.\nGlass "has an excuse for everything, and he should not be able to masquerade his deficiencies by claiming that he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt," Grunberg wrote in a filing.\nIn court, several justices asked for specific evidence of the kind of extraordinary behavior that would convince them that Glass had reformed. Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye acknowledged that Glass works hard and has gained the respect of others.\n"But I could say that for 90 percent of the people in this room," she said.\nThe court is expected to rule in the next 90 days. The case in the California Supreme Court is In re Stephen Randall Glass on Admission, S196374.\nThis story was originally published on Wed Nov 6, 2013 7:29 AM EST\nPopular Discussio

Woah.\nThe Republican Party of Texas, with help from the national GOP, will hire nearly two dozen full-time outreach workers over the next seven months, state GOP Chairman Steve Munisteri said Tuesday.\nThe extra employees will operate from five new field offices, courting Hispanics but also other nontraditional Republicans, such as blacks, Asian Americans and young people, Munisteri said.\nImagine if national Democrats were being forced to spend money in California or New York?\nDemographics are changing, and with it the political landscape. With Republicans playing defense in Texas, their future looks grim indeed.

USA TODAY\nRepublicans will face strong support%2C and opposition%2C to immigration bill when they return home\nSupporters will use marches%2C rallies and political donations to persuade GOP to embrace citizenship\nCritics feel they only have to maintain GOP opposition to %22amnesty%22 for undocumented immigrants\nWASHINGTON — As they prepare to leave the Capitol for a month-long August recess, Republican members of the House of Representatives are taking with them legislative summaries and informational packets to tackle tough questions in their districts about immigration.\nSupporters of a proposal to revamp the nation\'s immigration laws plan to use the recess to pressure House Republican members in their districts to pass a plan like that which passed the Senate in June.\nThose in favor of granting citizenship to an estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants say they will use rallies, marches, coordinated phone calls, social media campaigns and pressure from big-dollar donors.\n"This is the beginning of a long, hot summer for the House of Representatives," said Eliseo Medina of the Service Employees International Union, a labor union that supports the Senate\'s immigration bill.\nRepublicans will also face pressure from Tea Party groups and other opponents of the Senate immigration bill.\nRoy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, says his group, which advocates lower levels of legal and illegal immigration, hosted a teleconference with Reps. Steve King, R-Iowa, Steve Stockman, R-Texas, and Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., on Wednesday night to rally opponents to mobilize for the August recess.\nBeck said there were 40,000 people on the call.\n"Obviously, they\'ve got all of this money and all of these organizations and everything else, but we\'ve got over 2 million members. We\'re in every district," Beck said. "And they\'ve got a tough road to hoe. They\'ve got to change representatives\' minds. We\'re more in a situation of needing to hold people. It\'s always better to try to hold people to a position."\nGOP leaders said Republicans are looking forward to facing voters on the issue.\n"Our members will be well-prepared to talk with constituents about this important issue," said Nate Hodson, a spokesman for Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.\nHouse committees have passed five immigration-related bills that focus on enhancing border security, providing visas for high-tech and agricultural workers and enhancing the ability of state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws.\nThe Senate bill allows the nation\'s unauthorized immigrants to apply for U.S. citizenship, adds $46 billion to secure the border and revamps nearly every other portion of the nation\'s immigration laws.\nSupporters of an overhaul of immigration laws say House Republicans are focusing too much on border security and not on a pathway to citizenship for the nation\'s undocumented immigrants, which is a focus of the Senate plan.\nOn Monday, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to give a pro-immigration speech at the premier of the film Documented, which was directed by Jose Antonio Vargas, an immigration activist. A group of religious leaders will take a bus tour through Republican districts in the Midwest.\nClarissa Martinez of the National Council of La Raza, which supports legalization of all unauthorized immigrants, said a coalition of groups will host 360 different events in 52 congressional districts around the country during the recess.\nMeanwhile, some Republican donors and business groups will try to influence GOP members as well.\nRepublicans for Immigration Reform, a group formed by former GOP Commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez, sent a letter with other GOP donors this week to members of the House urging passage of a bill. Charlie Spies, a former fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said that was an attempt to add to the "grass-roots" approach by swaying members with their "grasstops" approach.\n"We\'re going to focus on engagement with constituents and business leaders who have actual relationships with members," Spies said. "You won\'t see us busing people in to town halls."\nRepublicans such as King say the border must be secured first before people in the USA illegally are offered citizenship. And some Tea Party affiliates plan to make sure representatives hear from the opponents to what they say is an "amnesty" for people who broke the law to be here.\n"It\'s not a battle that we picked," said Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin, referring to her group\'s typical focus on government spending.\n"It isn\'t an issue that was even on the front burner for us. But because of what the Senate has done and the House is now doing, it\'s something that we have to pay attention to."\nMartin said her group is working closely with NumbersUSA and others to hold rallies, attend town-hall-style forums and ensure that Republican members of Congress know the opposition they\'ll face if they support any kind of immigration reform they don\'t approve of.\n"We\'ve said all along that we\'re going to hold people accountable," Martin said. "We\'re holding them accountable."

From Lone Star Project:\nEarlier today (Wednesday), the three-judge Federal District Court in San Antonio handling the Texas redistricting litigation entered a final judgment in the Texas State Senate redistricting law suit. In its ruling, the Court made clear that Wendy Davis and her fellow plaintiffs in the case won and Greg Abbott, representing the Republican state leadership, lost.\nGreg Abbott served as the primary legal counsel to the State of Texas during the consideration of redistricting by the Legislature and defended the State’s redistricting plans in federal court. His efforts in redistricting have been nothing short of an embarrassing debacle.\nAbbott advised the Legislature to configure and adopt redistricting plans that the federal courts ruled to be in violation of the US Voting Rights Act. Two of the three redistricting plans were ruled to be drawn with discriminatory intent. Abbott has spent millions of dollars in Texas taxpayer funds to unsuccessfully defend redistricting plans that were unfair and illegal. Abbott’s actions go beyond partisanship to illustrate profound incompetence and open hostility to Hispanics, African Americans and other fair-minded Texans.\nhttp://lonestarproject.net/...\nHere is the entire court order:\nWENDY DAVIS; MARC VEASEY; ROY BROOKS; VICKY BARGAS; PAT PANGBURN; FRANCES DELEON; DOROTHY DEBOSE; and SARAH JOYNER\nPlaintiffs\nRICK PERRY, in his official capacity as Governor of the State of Texas;\nJOHN STEEN, in his official capacity as Secretary of State of the State of Texas;\nBOYD RICHIE, in his official capacity as Chair of the Texas Democratic Party;\nand STEVE MUNISTERI, in his official capacity as Chair of the Republican Party of Texas.\nDefendants\nFINAL JUDGMENT\nThis Court previously ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED:\nthat Plaintiffs’ request for declaratory relief was granted to the extent that Senate plan S100, the benchmark plan, violates the one-person, one-vote requirements of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and will not be used for any further elections;\nthat Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief was granted such that Senate plan S148, the 2011 enacted plan, has been permanently enjoined from implementation and no elections have been or will be held thereunder; and\nthat Plan S172, which was reviewed under the standard set forth in Perry v. Perez and restored district 10 to near benchmark configuration and remedied the constitutional infirmities being asserted by Plaintiffs, was to be used for the 2012 election.\nIt is further ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED:\nthat because (1) Plan S148 has been repealed, (2) Plaintiffs agree that Plan S172 does not violate the Voting Rights Act or the Constitution, and (3) Plaintiffs do not seek any further relief with regard to Plan S148, Plaintiffs’ remaining claims under § 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution are DISMISSED AS MOOT; and\nthat, as prevailing parties, Plaintiffs are awarded their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.\nPursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2) and W.D. Tex. Rule CV-7(j), Plaintiffs may file their applications for attorneys’ fees and costs no later than twenty days after entry of judgment. If the application is opposed in whole or in part, a response in opposition shall be filed no later than ten days after the filing of the application.\nSIGNED AND ENTERED this 4th day of September, 2013.\nhttp://lonestarproject.net/...\nIt sounds like Goposaur Abbott was trying to implement the discriminatory redistricting plan DESPITE it's already having been ruled illegal. That should be a crime in and of itself. Disgusting.\nSen. Davis, who heroically filibustered Texas' draconian abortion bill back in June, is looking more and more like a viable candidate for Texas governor. If I lived there, she would have my vote.\n___\nP.S. Condolences to Sen. Wendy Davis, whose father passed away this morning.\nhttp://www.wfaa.com/...

Los Angeles has elected its first Jewish mayor, Eric Garcetti, a three-term city councilman.\nMr Garcetti received 54% of the vote to City Controller Wendy Greuel\'s 46%.\nThe 42-year-old takes office in America\'s second-most populous city in July, when he will also become its second-consecutive Latino mayor.\nThe campaign was the most expensive in city history at $30m (£19m) overall, but only about one in four Los Angelenos voted on Tuesday.\nA tight election on 5 March had resulted in a run-off between the two city officials.\nJobs promise\n"We have sent a message tonight," Mr Garcetti said early on Wednesday to supporters.\nI know I am leaving Los Angeles in good handsAntonio Villaraigosa, Outgoing LA mayor\n"And that message is that LA is ready to put the recession in the rear-view mirror and to become the city of opportunity that I grew up in once again."\nHe tweeted that he was honoured to lead the city.\nThe city councilman promised voters during his campaign that he would increase jobs and patch up the city\'s battered streets and pavements.\nThe city faces growing budget problems with pension healthcare costs for municipal workers expected to rise.\nMr Garcetti also portrayed Ms Greuel as a pawn of powerful labour unions during the campaign.\n"A lot of people were telling me I needed to throw working people under the bus to win this race," said Ms Greuel late on Tuesday. "That was never going to happen on my watch."\nIn a statement, current Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said Mr Garcetti would "guide our city into its bright future. I know I am leaving Los Angeles in good hands."\nThe mayor-elect is also a Spanish speaker with Mexican roots like Mr Villaraigosa, but unlike the current mayor, Mr Garcetti grew up in an upmarket area of the city.\nMr Garcetti is the son of the former district attorney general who prosecuted football legend OJ Simpson on murder charges.

WASHINGTON — With studies suggesting that long lines at the polls cost Democrats hundreds of thousands of votes in November, party leaders are beginning a push to make voting and voter registration easier, setting up a likely new conflict with Republicans over a deeply polarizing issue.\nWhite House officials have told Congressional leaders that the president plans to press for action on Capitol Hill, and Democrats say they expect him to highlight the issue in his State of the Union address next week. Democrats in the House and Senate have already introduced bills that would require states to provide online voter registration and allow at least 15 days of early voting, among other things.\nFourteen states are also considering whether to expand early voting, including the battlegrounds of Florida, Ohio and Virginia, according to FairVote, a nonprofit group that advocates electoral change. Florida, New York, Texas and Washington are looking at whether to ease registration and establish preregistration for 16- and 17-year-olds.\nSeveral recent polls and studies suggest that long waiting times in some places depressed turnout in 2012 and that lines were longest in cities, where Democrats outnumber Republicans. In a New York Times/CBS News poll taken shortly after Election Day, 18 percent of Democrats said they waited at least a half-hour to vote, compared with 11 percent of independents and 9 percent of Republicans.\nA Massachusetts Institute of Technology analysis determined that blacks and Hispanics waited nearly twice as long in line to vote on average than whites. Florida had the nation’s longest lines, at 45 minutes, followed by the District of Columbia, Maryland, South Carolina and Virginia, according to Charles Stewart III, the political science professor who conducted the analysis.\nA separate analysis, by an Ohio State University professor and The Orlando Sentinel, concluded that more than 200,000 voters in Florida “gave up in frustration” without voting.\n“When I got there, the line was around the building,” said Jonathan Piccolo, 33, who said he had waited nearly eight hours to cast a ballot in Miami-Dade County the Monday before Election Day.\n“It’s one of the most sacred rights you have,” Mr. Piccolo added. “They should make it as painless as possible.”\nAs the Supreme Court prepares to hear a major challenge to the Voting Rights Act this month — with a decision potentially giving states more freedom to tighten voting requirements — election issues seem likely to become even more of a flash point.\nRepublicans in several states across the country have passed or promoted measures they say are meant to reduce voter fraud, like stricter identification requirements. Some have also cited costs; Florida, for instance, had eight days of early voting in November, down from 14, after the Republican-led Legislature changed the law.\nBy highlighting long waits and cumbersome voter registration as issues, Democrats hope they have found a counterattack. Democrats have already tried to block the Republican efforts, noting that nonpartisan analyses have generally found voter fraud to be extremely rare.\nWaiting times are “costing America a lot of votes,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat who is sponsoring the Senate voting bill and expects to have the full support of the White House.\nShe added, “We’ve talked to some of the White House staff about this from the beginning, and I think it’s something they care deeply about, and I think it’s something they will help us pass.”\nRepresentative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the assistant Democratic leader in the House, said he had received similar assurances from the White House. “I think he’s going devote a pretty significant amount of his political resources to bear on this question,” he said of President Obama.\nMr. Obama, a former community organizer who worked to register poor voters in Chicago, declared waiting times a top concern in speeches both on election night and at his second inauguration. “Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote,” he said on Inauguration Day.\nBut getting anything passed without Republican support will be impossible, Democrats acknowledge. And so far, conservatives have complained that Democrats are politicizing an issue that should be handled by the states, not the federal government.\n“It’s ridiculous to stand in line a couple of hours to vote,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. “But I think it’s also ridiculous to make a political issue out of it when it’s very easily handled.”\nBecause Democrats have been primarily focused on issues like gun control and immigration this year and have not yet devoted much time to voting rights, it is difficult to know their chances for success.\nTwo factors that help determine waiting times, experts say, are the length of the ballot and the number of voters per polling place. Mr. Stewart said California stood out as an example of a place that reduces waiting times by having relatively low numbers of voters per precinct.\n“Despite the fact that it’s a very large state, a very complicated state, and has the longest ballots in the Western world — all these things that you’d think would complicate voting — they don’t wait that long,” Mr. Stewart said.\nCalifornia’s had one of the 10 shortest average waits of any state, at six minutes, according to Mr. Stewart.\nIn some other places, including counties and cities run by Democrats, local officials have not spent the money to open as many polling places. The high turnout of young and minority voters in 2008 and 2012 may also have contributed to long lines.\nAshley Marie Lapadula, a student at Florida International University in Miami who said she voted for Mitt Romney in November, said she went to two different polling sites, leaving one where the wait appeared to be about three hours only to wait three hours at another.\nShe said she saw numerous voters, mostly Spanish speakers, leave. “Most of them said: ‘I have to get back to work. I don’t have time for this. This is incredible, the waiting is just too long,’ ” Ms. Lapadula said.\nTheodore T. Allen, a systems engineer at Ohio State who conducted the analysis of Florida voting last year, said that lengthy ballots also played an important role in how long voting takes. “It’s not because people are dumb or old,” he said. “It’s just that they have twice as much to read and process.”\nThe average wait nationwide was 14 minutes last year, according to Mr. Stewart’s data. Blacks and Hispanics waited an average of 20.2 minutes, compared with 12.7 minutes for whites. In the most populous areas — those with more than 500,000 voters in a county — the average wait was 18 minutes, more than double what it was in counties with fewer than 50,000 voters.\nAccording to Mr. Allen’s estimates, waiting times cost Mr. Obama a net of about 15,000 votes in Florida. He carried the state by about 74,000 votes.

The U.S., in their view, is capitalism's enforcer, and BTW, that applies to the 99% in the U.S. itself, viewed as a third-world country (Detroit, anyone?)\nThe neo-Confederates don't give a damn about the capitalist money system which has come to rule the world economy. They derive their attitude to the federal government from Jefferson Davis and the Southern secessionists. They are quite willing to trash the world economy if it somehow buys them the right to nullify federal laws with which they disagree.\nYou may be right that the ned-Confederates will get over it.

It was pure Economic Evil. Human Cruelty for Wealth and Profit. The Confederates were trying to <i>Protect and Continue</i> that system of Cruelty, of The THEFT of Freedom, Free Will and Choice for their own enrichment.</p>\n<p>But this is what they are, what they\'ve always been. They know it in their hearts, and this is why they truly FEAR - deeply in their bones - an African American President such as Barack Obama.

Governor Glenn McConnell posing with mock-slaves in a Civil War Uniform during the "Southern Experience" event for the National Federation of Republican Women. Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell\'s Celebration of "Confederate Day", Texas Governor Rick Perry\'s not-so-veiled threats of secession to the Rand Paul Staffer who called himself the "Confederate Avenger".\n[Just as an aside, I have my doubts that McConnell is actually wearing a Southern Uniform, it\'s Blue and that was the color of the Union Army. Edit: Nope, It\'s Confederate]\nAnd yet, there\'s more.\nLet\'s not let revisionism discolor what this was really all about. In it\'s letter of Secession, which was sent immediately after the Election of President Abraham Lincoln, even before he took Office, Texas stated the following:\nWe hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself, were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.\nThat in this free government all white men are and of right ought to be entitled to equal civil and political rights [emphasis in the original]; that the servitude of the African race, as existing in these States, is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations; while the destruction of the existing relations between the two races, as advocated by our sectional enemies, would bring inevitable calamities upon both and desolation upon the fifteen slave-holding states\nIt was merely the election of a President from a Party that endorsed Abolition, even if that President at the time DID NOT make accomplishing that party of his platform or an agenda item of his administration - that drove the South in a complete overreaction to losing an Election to begin to dismantle the nation State by State.\nAnd now today we see more and more Tea Partiers - while also overreacting to an election they lost - slowly endorsing the legitimacy of a new secession and further - of ABSOLUTE rights of the BUSINESS OWNER over their EMPLOYEES (as well as CLIENTS) in everything from denying them a living wage and working conditions to Dictating Whether they can have access to Preventive Services in their HealthCare, impose llfetime caps, and openly discriminate against those who had the temerity to previously GET SICK.\nApparently Modern Confederate Tea Partiers think the cruelty of that system is just "Fine".\nWither is Freedom then, eh?\nIn the last few years there have been a rising of Pro-Confederacy Groups who\'ve written such amazing revisionist history such as this.\nSoutherners have less reason to be loyal to the collective enterprise that is the United States than does any group of citizens. The South was Invaded, laid waste, and conquered when it tried to uphold the original and correct meaning of the Declaration of Independance and the Constitution.\nYeah, right, the South was "Invaded" - so much for those pesky letters of Secesion and that little Ft Sumter thing. Sure.\nAnd this happened merely because they felt they had the economic Right to continue practices such as this.\nSlavery was Evil. It was pure Economic Evil. Human Cruelty for Wealth and Profit. The Confederates were trying to Protect and Continue that system of Cruelty, of The THEFT of Freedom, Free Will and Choice for their own enrichment.\nBut this is what they are, what they\'ve always been. They know it in their hearts, and this is why they truly FEAR - deeply in their bones - an African American President such as Barack Obama. It is beyond their comprehension that he isn\'t racked with a deep desire for Vengence against Whites.\nHow could it not be?\nIt was this type of deep atavistic fear that even affected Barack Obama\'s own grandmother, Toot.

The entire conservative movement is nuts. Every damn one of them. When even the heads of their big, supposedly serious outlets spend their days doing little else but dreaming up new paranoid conspiracy theories (looking at you, Wayne LaPierre), there\'s just no conclusion other than the obvious one: Conservatism is just another name for batshit crazy:\nAccuracy In Media director Cliff Kincaid yesterday warned that allies of George Soros and President Obama are attempting to pick the next pope. Kincaid warns that a “group of radicals” in the “left-wing lobby in the U.S.” are trying to engineer the selection of Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson as Pope.\nKincaid’s argument boils down to the fact that Turkson introduced a document on global financial policy which was endorsed by Stephen Schneck of Catholic University (along with Pope Benedict XVI) and attended one of Schneck’s conferences in 2011.\nSince Schneck supported Obama’s reelection and is tied to the group Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, naturally Kincaid has arrived at the conclusion that Soros is plotting to pick the next pope in order to “use the Vatican in a global campaign against capitalism.”\nYep. The article is called “Black Socialist Pope to Follow Black Socialist President?”, which is the kind of headline someone like me would write in order to make them look crazy, but now they\'ve decided not to outsource that part anymore. Now, I\'m not exactly sure why George Soros (who used to run ACORN, before Agenda 21 installed manatees in all high-ranking ACORN positions) or anyone else would think of the good cardinal from Ghana as the "progressive" Catholic choice, much less the fellow who will oversee a systemic worldwide ruination of capitalism (again, you usually would pick someone from Wall Street for that job, or just call in Phil Gramm), but if any of this made sense then it wouldn\'t be movement conservatism. It just stands to reason that a guy who attended a conference held by a guy who liked Barack Obama better than Mitt Romney must be a secret socialist who Obama is planning in installing as pope using his secret cardinal-controlling Vatican Pope Drones. You\'d be crazy to not think so.\nRemember: There is absolutely nothing you can say or do that will discredit you in the eyes of the conservative movement. Absolutely nothing.

Our 50 states seem to be united in name only.\nIn fact, we seem to be increasingly becoming two countries under one flag: Liberal Land — coastal, urban and multicultural — separated by Conservative Country — Southern and Western, rural and racially homogeneous. (Other parts of the country are a bit of a mixed bag.)\nThis has led to incredible and disturbing concentrations of power.\nAs The New York Times reported after the election in November, more than two-thirds of the states are now under single-party control, meaning that one party has control of the governor’s office and has majorities in both legislative chambers.\nThis is the highest level of such control since 1952. And Republicans have single-party control in nearly twice as many states as Democrats.\nThis is having very real consequences on the ground, nowhere more clearly than on the subjects of voting rights and women’s reproductive rights.\nAlmost all jurisdictions covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — the section that requires federal approval for any change in voting procedures and that the Supreme Court effectively voided last month — are in Republican-controlled states.\nSo, many of those states have wasted no time following the court ruling to institute efforts to suppress the vote in the next election and beyond.\nWithin two hours of the Supreme Court ruling, Texas announced that a voter identification law that the Department of Justice had blocked for two years because “Hispanic registered voters are more than twice as likely as non-Hispanic registered voters to lack such identification” would go into effect, along with a redistricting map passed in 2011 but blocked by a federal court.\nThe department is trying to prevent those actions in Texas, but it’s unclear whether the state or the feds will prevail.\nAlabama, Mississippi and South Carolina have also moved forward with voter ID bills that had already passed but were being held up by the Justice Department. (Virginia has passed a bill that’s scheduled to go into effect next year.)\nAnd on Wednesday, a federal court gave Florida the go-ahead to resume its controversial voter purge by dismissing a case filed against the state that had been rendered moot by the Supreme Court decision.\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is not surprised by this flurry. She voted with the minority on the Voting Rights Act case, and she wrote in a strongly worded dissent: “The sad irony of today’s decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the VRA has proved effective. The Court appears to believe that the VRA’s success in eliminating the specific devices extant in 1965 means that preclearance is no longer needed.”\nShe continued, “With that belief, and the argument derived from it, history repeats itself.”\nHistory does appear to be doing just that. In an interview this week with The Associated Press, Ginsburg reiterated her displeasure with the court’s decision and her lack of surprise at what it has wrought, saying, “And one really could have predicted what was going to happen.” She added, “I didn’t want to be right, but sadly I am.”\nWhile Republicans may claim that voter ID laws are about the sanctity of the vote, Republican power brokers know they’re about much more: suppressing the votes of people likely to vote Democratic.\nLast week Rob Gleason, the Pennsylvania Republican Party chairman, discussed the effects of his state’s voter ID laws on last year’s presidential election, acknowledging to the Pennsylvania Cable Network: “We probably had a better election. Think about this: we cut Obama by 5 percent, which was big. A lot of people lost sight of that. He won — he beat McCain by 10 percent; he only beat Romney by 5 percent. I think that probably voter ID helped a bit in that.”\nAnd on women’s reproductive rights, as the Guttmacher Institute reported earlier this month, “In the first six months of 2013, states enacted 106 provisions related to reproductive health and rights.” The report continued, “Although initial momentum behind banning abortion early in pregnancy appears to have waned, states nonetheless adopted 43 restrictions on access to abortion, the second-highest number ever at the midyear mark and is as many as were enacted in all of 2012.”\nA substantial majority of the new restrictive measures — which include bans on abortion outside incredibly restrictive time frames (at six weeks after the woman’s last period in North Dakota), burdensome regulations on abortion clinics and providers, and forced ultrasounds — were enacted in states with Republican-controlled legislatures.\nThese are just two issues among many in which the cleaving of this country is becoming an incontrovertible fact, as we drift back toward bifurcation.

In a recent op-ed for The Post, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) offered up a reheated stew of isolated factoids and sweeping generalizations about climate science to defend the destructive status quo. We agree with the chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology that policy should be based on sound science. But Smith presented political talking points, and none of his implied conclusions is accurate.\nThe two of us have spent, in total, more than seven decades studying Earth’s climate, and we have joined hundreds of top climate scientists to summarize the state of knowledge for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the World Climate Research Program and other science-based bodies. We believe that our views are representative of the 97 percent of climate scientists who agree that global warming is caused by humans. Legions of studies support the view that, left unabated, this warming will produce dangerous effects. (This commentary, like so much of our work, was a collaborative process, with input from leading climate scientists Julia Cole, Robert W. Corell, Jennifer Francis, Michael E. Mann, Jonathan Overpeck, Alan Robock, Richard C.J. Somerville and Ben Santer.)\nWant a counterintuitive but thought-provoking approach to NSA? Read David Simon:\nIs it just me or does the entire news media — as well as all the agitators and self-righteous bloviators on both sides of the aisle — not understand even the rudiments of electronic intercepts and the manner in which law enforcement actually uses such intercepts? It would seem so.\n–\nBecause the national eruption over the rather inevitable and understandable collection of all raw data involving telephonic and internet traffic by Americans would suggest that much of our political commentariat, many of our news gatherers and a lot of average folk are entirely without a clue.\nYou would think that the government was listening in to the secrets of 200 million Americans from the reaction and the hyperbole being tossed about. And you would think that rather than a legal court order which is an inevitable consequence of legislation that we drafted and passed, something illegal had been discovered to the government’s shame.\nYes, there is another side to this.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday struck down an Arizona law that required people registering to vote in federal elections to show proof of citizenship, a victory for activists who said it had discouraged Native Americans and Latinos from voting.\nIn a 7-2 vote, the court, in an opinion written by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, ruled the voter registration provision of the 2004 state law was trumped by a federal law, the 1993 National Voter Registration Act.\nThe state law was opposed by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund and Indian tribes. They said it deterred legal voters who did not have the required paperwork from registering to vote.\nIt was another setback for the Republican leadership of a state, bordering Mexico, that has tried to crack down on illegal immigrants at a time when Hispanics represent the largest U.S. minority at nearly 17 percent of the population.\nBoth major political parties in Congress, aware of the increasingly influential Latino vote nationally, are trying to overhaul immigration laws with a bill that could provide a 13-year path to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants.\nAt the same time, the high court made clear that Arizona could still have other ways to assert its argument that it should be allowed to ask for proof of citizenship. That would be the subject of separate litigation, the court said.\n“It is a bit of a mixed bag, but at the end of the day it does reaffirm the absolute right to vote,” said Arizona state Senator Steve Gallardo, a Democrat.\nGallardo said the law unfairly made it seem as if there was massive fraud among Latino voters, which has never been proven. For a year, the Arizona Republican Party ... (has) been using different methods to disenfranchise Latino voters,” he said.\nArizona Republican Attorney General Tom Horne, who argued the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe state’s Republican leadership had said the law was meant to fight voter fraud, but Democrats countered that Republicans who championed the measures aimed to make it harder for minority voters who tend to vote Democratic to cast ballots.\nArizona is 30.1 percent Hispanic, according to 2011 census statistics. Its native American population is 5.2 percent compared with 1.2 percent nationwide.\nRULING AFFECTS THREE OTHER STATES\nThe ruling will affect three other states - Georgia, Alabama and Kansas - that have similar laws, and prevent others that may have wanted to follow suit from enacting legislation along the same lines.\nFederal law requires prospective voters to provide one of several possible forms of identification, such as a driver’s license or a passport, but no proof of citizenship is needed. Would-be voters simply sign a statement saying they are citizens.\nThe top court battle was the latest for Arizona’s Republican leadership.\nLast year, the court upheld one provision of the state’s crackdown on illegal immigrants but threw out three other parts, handing a partial victory to President Barack Obama in his challenge to the law. Critics of that 2010 Arizona law argued it could lead to illegal racial or ethnic profiling of Hispanics.\nSlideshow (2 Images)\nIn Monday’s majority opinion, Scalia said the state law was pre-empted by language in the federal statute saying that states must “accept and use” a federal registration form. The state law ordered officials to reject the form if there was no accompanying proof of citizenship.\nThe two dissenters, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, said in their separate opinions that states alone have the authority to decide voter qualifications.\nIn outlining the limitations of the ruling, Scalia focused on the role of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, a federal agency that oversees changes to state voter registration procedures. The commission rejected the Arizona plan, prompting several justices to ponder during oral arguments in April why the state did not file a lawsuit challenging the decision.\nScalia said Arizona could still ask the commission to include a citizenship provision on the federal form in the future and could challenge the current form in separate litigation. “That alternative means of enforcing its constitutional power to determine voting qualifications remains open to Arizona here,” he wrote.\nScalia noted the commission already has granted Louisiana permission to require additional materials as proof of identification if an applicant does not have a driver’s license, identification card or Social Security number.\nRick Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law, said Arizona could win future litigation on the issue in light of the Louisiana decision.\nThe case began when Arizona residents, civil rights groups and Indian tribes sued to challenge the state measure, which they said discriminated against otherwise eligible voters, among them members of more than a score of Native American tribes across the rugged desert state, some of whom struggle to meet additional requirements.\nNina Perales, vice president of litigation at the Mexican American legal defense group that opposed the law, said the ruling “sends a strong message that states cannot block their citizens from registering to vote by superimposing burdensome paperwork requirements on top of federal law.”\nThe case is Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 12-71.

The morning after the President actually discussed climate change in the State of the Union address, a group of prominent people are heading to the White House to risk arrest in a call on the President to live up to those words on the need to act on climate change. The Keystone XL pipeline, in and of itself, isn\'t enough to \'cook the planet\' -- it is, however, a key tool to foster expanded production of Canadian Tar Sands. And, along with failures to reduce coal consumption, that expanded production could be enough (even without considering all other issues) to hammer in the last nail on the potential for humanity to avert catastrophic climate chaos.\nToday\'s Tar Sands Action will have 50 prominent American leaders (see here for list with quotes from most as to why they are willing to be handcuffed and hauled to prison) from a range of domains.\nJeremy Grantham -- an excellent financial analyst and advisor -- is a powerful symbol of mounting business and financial concerns. [Update: just learned that Grantham will be there but will not risk arrest although his daughter will ...]\nRev Lennox Yearwood, Jr, is the head of the Hip Hop Caucus and is representative of youth, religious, and the rainbow reality of concerns over climate change.\nJulian Bond -- truly a civil rights legend -- links climate change issues to the rich legacy of our nation\'s struggles for civil justice.\nDarryl Hannah provides an example to our other \'stars\' about the need to put their celebrity on the line and in the struggle to avert Climate Disruption.\nRandy Thompson -- a Nebraska rancher -- provides a powerful symbol of American farmers\' growing realization of how climate disruption is already impacting their lives and of how promoting fossil foolish development is simply, well, outright foolish.\nMichael Brune -- the Executive Director of the Sierra Club -- is a strong symbol of how seriously traditional environmental organizations are taking the struggle against climate change and against Keystone XL\nAs for the last, the Sierra Club has never authorized civil disobedience in its 120 year history ... until now.\n2012 was the hottest year on record, half the country is in severe drought, and Superstorm Sandy just flooded the greatest city in the world–New York. A global crisis unfolds before our eyes and immediate action is required. President Obama has the executive authority to make a significant and immediate impact on carbon pollution, and he can begin by saying no to Big Oil by rejecting the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline.\nCivil disobedience is the response of ordinary people to extraordinary injustices. Americans have righted the wrongs of our society – slavery, child labor, suffrage, segregation, and inequality for gays and immigrant workers – with creative nonviolent resistance.\nClimate change threatens the health and security of all Americans, and action proportional to the problem is required–now.\nVery simply, the Keystone XL pipeline is not in America\'s national interest. Enabling expanded tar sands exploitation is not in humanity\'s interest. Last night, President Obama said:\nBut for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change.\nMr. President, with a swipe of a pen, here is a chance for you to "do more to combate climate change."\nYou "must do more".

The US aviation regulator has announced the six states that will host sites for testing commercial use of drones.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) picked Alaska, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Texas and Virginia.\nThe sites are part of a programme to develop safety and operational rules for drones by the end of 2015.\nHitherto mainly used by the military, the potential of drones is now being explored by everyone from real estate agents to farmers or delivery services.\nThe head of the FAA, Michael Huerta, said safety would be the priority as it considers approval for unleashing the unmanned aircraft into US skies.\nPilots will be notified through routine announcements about where drones are being flown.\nThe FAA said in a statement that its decision followed a 10-month process involving proposals from 24 states.\nThe agency said it had considered geography, climate, location of ground infrastructure, research needs, airspace use, aviation experience and risk.\nThe sites chosen are:\nA set of locations proposed by the University of Alaska in seven zones with varying climates, from Hawaii to Oregon\nGriffiss International Airport in central New York state will test how to integrate drones into the congested north-east airspace\nNorth Dakota Department of Commerce will test the human impact of drones and also how the aircraft cope in temperate climates\nThe state of Nevada will concentrate on standards for air traffic and drone operators\nTexas A&M University plans to develop safety requirements for drones and testing for airworthiness\nVirginia Tech university will research operational and technical areas of risk for drones\nThe biggest chunk of the growth in the commercial drone industry is currently expected to be for agriculture and law enforcement.\nPolice and other emergency services could use them for crowd control, taking crime scene photos or for search and rescue missions.\nIt can cost a police department hundreds of dollars an hour to deploy a helicopter, while an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be sent into the skies for as little as $25.\nFarmers, meanwhile, might find it easier to spray crops or survey livestock with the pilotless aircraft.\nThe FAA estimates as many as 7,500 aircraft could be in the air five years after widespread airspace access is made legal.\nHowever, the commercial use of drones has drawn criticism from both conservatives and liberals.\nIn a report last December, the American Civil Liberties Union said that giving drones access to US skies would only ensure "our every move is monitored, tracked, recorded and scrutinised by the authorities".\nBut lawmakers from winning states were delighted with the selections.\n"This is wonderful news for Nevada that creates a huge opportunity for our economy," said Senator Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada.\nAn industry-commissioned study predicted more than 70,000 jobs - including drone operators - would develop in the first three years after Congress loosens drone restrictions on US skies.\nThe same study, conducted by the Teal Group research firm, found that the worldwide commercial drone market could top $89bn in the next decade.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A massive cross that serves as part of a war memorial on a San Diego hilltop must be dismantled because it has been found to violate a constitutional ban on government endorsement of religion, a federal judge grudgingly ruled on Thursday.\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Larry Burns marks the latest development in a long-running legal battle over the 43-foot-tall cross, a local landmark that has stood on top of Mount Soledad since 1954 and is visible for miles.\nBurns stayed his order to give the Obama administration and the association that erected the cross, which have fought its removal all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, a chance to file another appeal. Otherwise, he said, the monument must be taken down within 90 days.\n"This is a victory for religious liberty," said Daniel Mach, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\'s program on freedom of religion and belief who argued the matter for the plaintiffs in a hearing before Burns on Thursday.\n"We firmly support the government\'s efforts to honor the service of those who fought and died for this country, but there are many ways to do that without playing favorites with religion," Mach said.\nThe case hinged on whether it is legal for a religious symbol to be prominently displayed on public land and whether the cross violated the U.S. Constitution\'s requirement on separation of church and state.\nThe Mount Soledad cross has been the subject of litigation since 1989, when two veterans sued San Diego to get it off city land. In 2006, Congress intervened in the dispute, resulting in the federal government taking ownership of the property.\nA group of plaintiffs, including the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America, then sued. The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals court ruled that the dominance of the cross conveyed a message of government endorsement of religion.\nThe Obama administration and the Mount Soledad Memorial Association, which erected the cross, appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, supported by 20 U.S. states and various veterans groups in arguing the cross should be allowed as part of the memorial.\nIn June 2012, the Supreme Court declined to take the case, letting the Ninth Circuit\'s ruling stand. In ordering that the cross be taken down, Burns said on Thursday he did not agree with the Ninth Circuit\'s ruling but that his hands were tied.\nThe cross, located between the Pacific Ocean and a major interstate highway, is surrounded by walls displaying granite plaques that commemorate veterans or veterans groups. Easter services were held annually at the cross from 1954 until at least 2000, according to court documents.\nThe Mount Soledad Memorial Association, which erected the cross in place of another cross that had stood on that spot since 1913, could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday\'s ruling.

The morning after the President actually discussed climate change in the State of the Union address, a group of prominent people are heading to the White House to risk arrest in a call on the President to live up to those words on the need to act on climate change. The Keystone XL pipeline, in and of itself, isn\'t enough to \'cook the planet\' -- it is, however, a key tool to foster expanded production of Canadian Tar Sands. And, along with failures to reduce coal consumption, that expanded production could be enough (even without considering all other issues) to hammer in the last nail on the potential for humanity to avert catastrophic climate chaos.\nToday\'s Tar Sands Action will have 50 prominent American leaders (see here for list with quotes from most as to why they are willing to be handcuffed and hauled to prison) from a range of domains.\nJeremy Grantham -- an excellent financial analyst and advisor -- is a powerful symbol of mounting business and financial concerns. [Update: just learned that Grantham will be there but will not risk arrest although his daughter will ...]\nRev Lennox Yearwood, Jr, is the head of the Hip Hop Caucus and is representative of youth, religious, and the rainbow reality of concerns over climate change.\nJulian Bond -- truly a civil rights legend -- links climate change issues to the rich legacy of our nation\'s struggles for civil justice.\nDarryl Hannah provides an example to our other \'stars\' about the need to put their celebrity on the line and in the struggle to avert Climate Disruption.\nRandy Thompson -- a Nebraska rancher -- provides a powerful symbol of American farmers\' growing realization of how climate disruption is already impacting their lives and of how promoting fossil foolish development is simply, well, outright foolish.\nMichael Brune -- the Executive Director of the Sierra Club -- is a strong symbol of how seriously traditional environmental organizations are taking the struggle against climate change and against Keystone XL\nAs for the last, the Sierra Club has never authorized civil disobedience in its 120 year history ... until now.\n2012 was the hottest year on record, half the country is in severe drought, and Superstorm Sandy just flooded the greatest city in the world–New York. A global crisis unfolds before our eyes and immediate action is required. President Obama has the executive authority to make a significant and immediate impact on carbon pollution, and he can begin by saying no to Big Oil by rejecting the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline.\nCivil disobedience is the response of ordinary people to extraordinary injustices. Americans have righted the wrongs of our society – slavery, child labor, suffrage, segregation, and inequality for gays and immigrant workers – with creative nonviolent resistance.\nClimate change threatens the health and security of all Americans, and action proportional to the problem is required–now.\nVery simply, the Keystone XL pipeline is not in America\'s national interest. Enabling expanded tar sands exploitation is not in humanity\'s interest. Last night, President Obama said:\nBut for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change.\nMr. President, with a swipe of a pen, here is a chance for you to "do more to combate climate change."\nYou "must do more".

A judge has dismissed a federal lawsuit against the city of Naperville filed by opponents to its smart meter program.\nThe city has installed smart meters on more than 57,000 homes that officials say will help them operate the electric system in a more efficient, reliable and cost-effective manner.\nBut members of the Naperville Smart Meter Awareness group filed a federal lawsuit in December 2011 citing "a multitude of serious health, safety, security and privacy concerns" over the meters that wirelessly transmit data about electric use to the city, which runs the utility. Smart meter opponents allege in the suit the city has violated their constitutional rights to due process, protection from unreasonable searches and protection from the government taking private property.\nJudge John Z. Lee questioned both sides about the case for about two hours in September and issued a 24-page written decision Friday that dismisses the claims. In the opinion, he writes the smart meter opponents did not exhaust all state remedies for their claims and did not prove radio frequency from the meters is actually harming people. He also found the city has precautions in place to keep customer data from being disclosed without their consent and rejected the claim the city will collect personal details about customers\' lives.\n"Even assuming that a smart meter is technically able to measure electrical usage and load to such minute detail, and one were able to ascertain personal details about a resident\'s life from such data, the mere existence of such a capability does not reasonably lead to an inference that it is actually being employed," Lee wrote.\n"Obviously we\'re pleased with the outcome," Krieger said. "We believe the federal court got it right in granting the motion to dismiss."\nKrieger did not immediately have a figure as to how much money the city has spent defending the lawsuit.\nLee said he will allow the smart meter opponents to re-file an amended lawsuit within 14 days and the group said it plans to do just that.\n"We see it really as a very big positive," said Jennifer Stahl, secretary of Naperville Smart Meter Awareness. "The judge writing his 24-page opinion provides a lot of insight as to what his perspective is regarding the case. He could have dismissed it with prejudice which would have been it\'s over, period."\nStahl said the group will introduce new evidence including the January arrests of herself and the group\'s president, Kim Bendis. The two are accused of interfering with meter installation.

Oh God, no. No, no, no.\nIn the months before the 2012 election, a group of high-powered consultants and political operatives prepared a secret report for candidate Mitt Romney, explaining how he should take over and restructure the federal government should he win the presidency. […]\nBut now the secret is out. On May 29, the Romney Readiness Project, the Republican candidate’s transition organization known as R2P, published a 138-page report detailing how it prepared for a potential Romney victory.\nThe actual document is horrifying. It\'s horrifying in exactly the way you\'d expect it to be horrifying, coming from Mitt Freaking Romney\'s camp. It proposes treating the entire executive branch like a big financial firm, because THAT IS WHAT MITT ROMNEY KNOWS AND LOVES, PUNY FLESH-HUMANS.\n“The White House staff is similar to a holding company” read one PowerPoint slide, which would have been presented to President-elect Romney as part of an expansive briefing on the morning after Election Day. It went on to list three main divisions of the metaphorical firm: “Care & Feeding Offices,” like speechwriting, “Policy Offices,” like the National Security Council, and “Packaging & Selling Offices,” like the office of the press secretary.\nI see now how narrowly the satirists, comedians and other snarkish wags of America averted catastrophe last November. There is no way anyone with any sense of humor could have survived the first hundred days of a Mitt Romney "let\'s treat the Oval Office like a big Wall Street firm" presidency without dying outright. The true cynics would have been killed off within a week; the optimists, within a month. It was a cunning plan to murder comedy outright.\nAmong the recommendations for the Romney administration:\n• Corporate-style training seminars were planned for appointees and nominees before the inauguration to teach management skills.\n• A plan to restructure White House operations to suit Romney’s corporate management style, with clear deliverables.\n• Detailed flow charts delineating how information and decisions were disseminated through the administration to achieve “unity.”\nOnce you get past the inherent terror of someone trying to think of the White House as a "holding company" and whatnot, most of the supposed details of the plan seem simplistic at best, for something allegedly the product of a 500 person team—for example, a long series of slides explaining how the White House is organized, written with words like "COO" and "Selling" in an apparent attempt to explain these things to whatever executive business critters were going to be brought on board to run those things. The policy prescriptions are broad and consist almost entirely of the same one-sentence vows Romney was making in various campaign forums. (Given that more than a few tax dollars helped pay for them to come up with this stuff, charging the general public $24.95 to see the depressing end results seems a bit insulting.)\nThe White House as holding company, though–gonna be seeing that one in my nightmares. Now I know how the people in Russia felt when that meteor whizzed over their heads.

lockquote>\n<p>There is apparently a rumor that Chan is planning a run for Mayor in 2015, which she wouldn\'t confirm or deny. Right. We\'ll see how that goes for her.</p>', 'text': 'A proposed non-discrimination ordinance in San Antonio barring discrimination against LGBT people has been a source of considerable controversy as of late. Right-wing individuals and groups have predictably smeared the proposal and tried to whip up fear and make it out to be "anti-religion." And now, the plot thickens, as Republican Councilwoman Elisa Chan has been outed by a former staffer as an outright homophobe.\nJames Stevens, who served as an aide to Chan, has resigned this week, but he\'s going out with a bang. Unbeknownst to Chan and the other staffers, he had recorded a private meeting from May 21 about the ordinance on his iPhone. What the recording reveals, other than the fact that Chan is an idiot and had some idiots working for her, is a rather appalling anti-gay conversation between Chan and her staffers. During the course of the conversation, one of her staffers brings up incest and bestiality and Chan herself calls homosexuality disgusting and says that gay people should not be allowed to adopt. Some pretty extreme homophobia on display.\nI\'m going to embed the 15-minute recording below, which you should listen to if you have the stomach. But here are some of Chan\'s "gems" extracted by the San Antonio Express-News:\nBy the way, this is politically incorrect. I don’t think homosexual people should do adoption. They should be banned by adoption. You’re going to confuse those kids. They should be banned.\nIf you wanted to choose that lifestyle, we don’t want to discriminate you, but you shouldn’t affect the young people. How terrible. … They’re going to be confused. You see two men go into a bedroom. You see two women kissing. Is that not confusing? It’s confusing.\nIt is actually, what you call, suggestive, for the kids to be corrupt, which is against nature. I’m telling you, anything that is against nature is not right.\nYou know, to be quite honest, I know this is not politically correct. I never bought in that you are born, that you are born gay. I can’t imagine it.\nWhen I say that it’s … behavioral preference, they say that, "No, you’re born with it." But I never bought into that.\nI think it’s just disgusting just to even think about.\nPerhaps even more interesting is how far she\'s willing to go to cover up her obviously antiquated views from the public.\nIn strategizing on how to oppose the anti-discrimination ordinance, Chan decided to have her staff draft an op-ed to appear in a local paper.\n“Can you guys come up with a draft?” she asks her aides. “Come up with draft with all the good, those arguments we talk as a speaking point, in terms of we’re addressing an issue that is not an issue. This is national politics again at the council level.\n“This is another layer of bureaucracy, that we have not heard any discrimination,” she continues. “And then add in the family value in there. … Maybe I’ll use the industries, that we have a trend, that is, maybe I’ll use we have water rates and CPS rates to worry about.”\n“Maybe what we can do, can we maybe throw some questionable confusions like, OK, this ‘transgender,’ because the definition is so broad…”\nListen to the horrifying recording yourself:\nChan\'s then-chief of policy Jeff Bazan is the one on the recording who warns that we\'re on a slippery slope toward incest and bestiality (how original, right?) and tells Chan to be a "culture warrior" on the issue. Well, he\'s now working for pro-gay Democrat Ron Nirenberg, who was just elected to the City Council, as his chief of staff. Can somebody say awkward? Bazan released the following statement yesterday:\nI was basically explaining the viewpoint that some people have on the gay marriage issue. What I said was wrong and I deeply regret it. I can say that those comments, which were intended to be purely political, do not reflect my heart. Councilman Nirenberg, whom I currently serve and support, has made it clear that discrimination is not negotiable, and I am proud to work for him.\nRight.\nAs for Chan, she acted as if she didn\'t know Stevens at first when confronted about the recording. Then she had this to say:\nI think that\'s in a private setting and I don\'t know if that\'s — I need to hear that recording to know. I\'m not quite sure what you\'re talking about so maybe you can play that back to me. We talk a lot of things in the staff meetings, so I wanted to know also under what context.\nThere is apparently a rumor that Chan is planning a run for Mayor in 2015, which she wouldn\'t confirm or deny. Right. We\'ll see how that goes for her.

Lawyers for groups opposed to same-sex marriage in California petitioned to reverse a federal appeals court order that OK\'d the resumption of such unions -- doing so a day after that ruling.\nAttorneys applied Saturday to the U.S. Supreme Court for "an immediate order vacating" a decision Friday by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to copies of the document from ProtectMarriage.com and the Alliance Defending Freedom. That appeals court Friday lifted a previous injunction on same-sex marriages in California, "effective immediately."\n"Without the immediate relief requested by this Application, the Ninth Circuit will circumvent the proper rules and procedures established by this Court," the application says.\nThose on the other side of the debate, meanwhile, think the appeals court acted appropriately.\n"The Ninth Circuit had broad discretion as to whether to stay the injunction pending appeal," said Manny Rivera, a spokesman for the American Foundation for Equal Rights. "Now that the Supreme Court has decided that the injunction against Proposition 8 must stand, it was entirely appropriate for the Ninth Circuit to dissolve its stay of that injunction."\nCalifornia\'s Supreme Court struck down the state\'s ban on same-sex marriage in May 2008, ruling that the state\'s constitution gives "this basic civil right to (marry to) all Californians, whether gay or heterosexual, and to same-sex couples as well as to opposite-sex couples."\nBut months later, 52% of voters backed Proposition 8 to once again restrict marriages so that they can only be between a man and a woman.\nState officials declined to stand behind Proposition 8 -- and, thus, its prohibition on gay marriage -- though private parties did step in and offer to do so.\nA federal appeals court later ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, though it still issued a stay on same-sex marriages until the U.S. Supreme Court could weigh in.\nThat happened in a 5-4 decision Wednesday, when the high court dismissed an appeal of that federal court ruling on jurisdictional grounds. That meant Friday\'s news -- the resumption of same-sex marriages in California -- was expected, even though it wasn\'t known when it would happen.\nIn their emergency application, affiliated lawyers claimed the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals "lacked jurisdiction to issue its order purporting to dissolve the stay." They reasoned that this appeals court wasn\'t authorized to weigh in until the Supreme Court "sends a certified copy of the judgment to the Ninth Circuit."\nAmong other arguments, the application also stated that "permitting the Ninth Circuit to prematurely dissolve its stay order would effectively deprive petitioners of a meaningful opportunity to exercise their right to petition for rehearing."\nSuch petitions for the Supreme Court to reconsider a case must be filed within 25 days after a ruling has been made.\nIt\'s unclear if and/or when the high court might consider this request. Justices recently began a recess after issuing a number of pivotal rulings last week.\nAnd there\'s no immediate indication it will have any impact on same-sex weddings taking place around California. Gov. Jerry Brown issued a directive on Friday telling authorities in "58 California counties that same-sex marriage is now legal in California and that marriage licenses must be issued to same-sex couples immediately."\nAttorney General Kamala Harris, in fact, performed one of the first such unions -- between Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier, who were one of the couples who sued to stop a voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage from taking effect -- at San Francisco\'s City Hall.

Looks like there's trouble in the Cheney clan. Liz Cheney is running for something, and in the Republican party running for something means you're against gay marriage, even though her own sister is gay. Her father Dick is not running for anything anymore, which means he has been freed to have a non-scummy opinion on the subject—and really, when noted torture-of-prisoners advocate Dick Cheney is not a gigantic asshole about something, it stands out. So now we get to watch the spectacle of Dick and Lynne Cheney releasing a public statement distancing themselves from their campaigning daughter.\nThis is an issue we have dealt with privately for many years, and we are pained to see it become public. Since it has, one thing should be clear. Liz has always believed in the traditional definition of marriage. She has also treated her sister and her sister's family with love and respect, exactly as she should have done. Compassion is called for, even when there is disagreement about such a fundamental matter and Liz's many kindnesses shouldn't be used to distort her position.\nI like how they preemptively defend Liz from the notion that she's just pretending to be an intolerant ass on the subject. Oh no, dear Republicans, we assure you Liz has always been an intolerant ass about this. For years! She just swallows her bile in front of her sister, most of the time, because family and whatnot.\nPut this up as another reason you probably never want to eat dinner with the Cheney family on Thanksgiving. That is probably going to be one, er, interesting evening. (And I hope they're not going to be cooking anyone we know.)

NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Worried they could be sued by gay couples, some churches are changing their bylaws to reflect their view that the Bible allows only marriage between one man and one woman.\nAlthough there have been suits against wedding industry businesses that refuse to serve gay couples, attorneys promoting the bylaw changes say they don\'t know of any lawsuits against churches.\nCritics say the changes are unnecessary, but some churches fear that it\'s only a matter of time before one of them is sued.\n"I thought marriage was always between one man and one woman, but the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision said no," said Gregory S. Erwin, an attorney for the Louisiana Baptist Convention, an association of Southern Baptist churches and one several groups advising churches to change their bylaws. "I think it\'s better to be prepared because the law is changing. America is changing."\nIn a June decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as between a man and a woman for purposes of federal law. A second decision was more technical but essentially ushered in legal gay marriage in California.\nKevin Snider is an attorney with the Pacific Justice Institute, a nonprofit legal defense group that specializes in conservative Christian issues. His organization released a model marriage policy a few years ago in response to a statewide gay marriage fight in California. Snider said some religious leaders have been threatened with lawsuits for declining to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies.\nDean Inserra, head pastor of the 1,000-member City Church Tallahassee, based in Florida, said he does not want to be alarmist, but his church is looking into how best to address the issue.\nInserra said he already has had to say no to gay friends who wanted him to perform a wedding ceremony.\n"We have some gay couples that attend our church. What happens when they ask us to do their wedding?" Inserra said. "What happens when we say no? Is it going to be treated like a civil rights thing?"\nCritics, including some gay Christian leaders, argue that the changes amount to a solution looking for a problem.\n"They seem to be under the impression that there is this huge movement with the goal of forcing them to perform ceremonies that violate their freedom of religion," said Justin Lee, executive director of the Gay Christian Network, a nonprofit that provides support for gay Christians and their friends and families and encourages churches to be more welcoming.\n"If anyone tried to force a church to perform a ceremony against their will, I would be the first person to stand up in that church\'s defense."\nThirteen states and the District of Columbia now recognize gay marriage.\nSome Christian denominations, such as the United Church of Christ and the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, accept gay marriage. The Episcopal Church recently approved a blessing for same-sex couples, but each bishop must decide whether to allow the ceremony in his or her local diocese.\nThe majority of Christian denominations, however, view homosexual relationships as sinful. In more hierarchical denominations, like the Roman Catholic Church or the United Methodist Church, individual churches are bound by the policies of the larger denomination. But nondenominational churches and those loosely affiliated with more established groups often individually decide how to address social issues such as gay marriage.\nEric Rassbach is an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a public interest legal group that defends the free expression rights of all faiths. He said it is unlikely the government would try to force a pastor to perform a same-sex marriage, but churches that rent out their facilities to the general public could face problems if they refuse to rent to gay couples.\nAlthough his organization has not advocated it, he said it could strengthen a church\'s legal position to adopt a statement explaining its beliefs about marriage.\n"A number of groups don\'t have a written doctrine," Rassbach said. "Say a group like the Primitive Baptists -- they don\'t want a written-down credo, but the courts like written-down things."\nRassbach said it was important for churches to get their beliefs in writing before a dispute arises, otherwise it can look to a court as if something was done after the fact as an attempt to cover up hostility to gays.\nAirline Baptist Church Senior Pastor Chad Mills said members of the public use their facilities in is Bossier City, La., for many activities, including Zumba classes. In the past, anyone who could pay the fee was allowed to reserve the space. But recently, the church changed its rental policy to allow wedding-related events only for male-female couples.\nSome denominations are less concerned about the Supreme Court rulings. The Assemblies of God, the group of churches comprising the world\'s largest Pentecostal denomination, sought legal advice after the rulings. An attorney for the group distributed a memo to ministers saying there was no reason to change their bylaws.\nHowever, the memo also said that "doing so is not inappropriate, and may be warranted based on future rulings by the Supreme Court and other state and federal courts."\nThe bylaw changes are coming at a time when many churches are wrestling with gay marriage in general and are working hard to be more welcoming to gays and lesbians.\n"It\'s probably one of the most difficult issues our churches are facing right now," said Doug Anderson, a national coordinator with the evangelical Vineyard Church. "It\'s almost an impossible situation to reconcile what\'s going on in our culture, and our whole theology of welcoming and loving people, versus what it says in the Bible."

A day after his administration formally weighed in on an upcoming Supreme Court case on gay marriage, President Barack Obama said he felt the issue required a response that reflected "what I believe."\n"I felt it was important for us to articulate what I believe and what this administration stands for," he said during a press conference at the White House.\nAfter first indicating that it would not get involved in the case, the Justice Department on Thursday filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case over the constitutionality of California\'s "Proposition 8," which banned same-sex marriage in the state after thousands of gay couples had already legally tied the knot.\nObama, who publicly changed course and embraced same sex marriage last year, said that he hopes that the court rules to strike down not just California\'s ban on gay marriage but equivalent restrictions in other states.\n"The court may decide that if [a ban on same sex marriage] doesn\'t apply in this case, it probably can\'t apply in any case. There is no good reason for it," he said. "If I were on the court, that would probably be the view that I\'d put forward."\n"But I\'m not a judge. I\'m the president," he added. "The basic principle, though, is let\'s treat everybody fairly, let\'s treat everybody equally, and -- and I think that the brief that\'s been presented accurately reflects our views."\nPopular Discussio

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Hundreds of supporters of same-sex marriage rights assembled at the Rhode Island Statehouse on Tuesday, urging lawmakers to make the nation\'s smallest state the 10th to allow gay and lesbian couples to wed — and the last to do so in New England.\nHouse Speaker Gordon Fox, who is gay, has called for a vote on same-sex marriage legislation in his chamber by month\'s end, making Rhode Island the latest state to address an issue whose supporters see things swinging their way after voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington approved gay marriage last fall.\nAbout 300 supporters and opponents signed up to address the legislative committee reviewing the bill — they were limited to 2 minutes each to keep the hearing from going all night — while hundreds more gathered in the hallways outside the hearing.\nDownstairs, a raucous rally of gay-marriage opponents beneath the Statehouse rotunda at times drowned out those testifying in the third-floor committee room.\n"I\'d like us to get on the right side of history," said Josephine O\'Connell, 71, of Providence, who said it "breaks her heart" that her home state is the only one in New England that doesn\'t allow gays and lesbians like her to marry. "I don\'t want to be looking back in 20 years, thinking \'what were we thinking?\'"\nGov. Lincoln Chafee, an independent, and Treasurer Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, both spoke out in favor of gay marriage at the hearing.\n"I\'m here as your treasurer, but I\'m really here as a mother and wife," said Raimondo. "Every Rhode Islander deserves the same rights that we have."\nHundreds of others showed up to urge lawmakers in this heavily Catholic state to drop the legislation and protect the current definition of marriage.\nThe Roman Catholic Church opposes the legislation on religious grounds — and more practical ones. The Rev. Bernard Healey told lawmakers that the Providence Diocese is concerned Catholic schools and charitable organizations could be forced to change their employee benefit policies if compelled to recognize the same-sex spouses of employees.\n"We are here to defend and support the longstanding definition of marriage... as the exclusive and lasting relationship of a man and a woman," Healey said. "Using the law to alter or redefine marriage is an injustice to those who have embraced this way of life."\nOthers warned that allowing gay marriage would erode social norms.\n"Just because these states in New England have decided to redefine marriage doesn\'t mean we should follow them down this path," said Michael Krzywonos of Pawtucket. "The polygamists will be next in line. Then we\'ll begin to test the boundaries of what age is permissible. And then we will test whether love and marriage can only be between two people."\nSupporters are hoping to build on national momentum following the votes in Maine, Maryland and Washington. Meanwhile, in Minnesota, voters rejected a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have prohibited gay marriage, the first time such a ballot question has failed in the United States.\nLawmakers in Illinois are also expected to consider gay marriage this year.\nSupporters in Rhode Island expect the measure will pass the Democrat-controlled House but concede the state Senate is more challenging. Senate President Teresa Paiva Weed, a Newport Democrat, is a gay marriage opponent but has said she will allow a committee vote on the legislation should it pass the House. She said Tuesday that she would not vote for the legislation as it\'s currently written.\nState lawmakers have passed civil unions for gay couples, and Chafee signed an executive order recognizing gay marriages performed in other states.

More\nTwo Utah Boy Scout leaders could lose their memberships unless they agree to apologize to local organization officials for marching with other Scouts in the Utah Pride Parade in Salt Lake City.\nOfficials from the Great Salt Lake Council of the Boy Scouts of America said both Peter Brownstein and Neil Whitaker violated the organization\'s policy that forbids using Scouting to promote a political position, The Associated Press reported.\n"We were very disappointed that you used Scouting to advance the gay agenda at the Utah Pride Parade," council leaders wrote to Brownstein, according to the AP. "You and others are welcome to participate in the parade as supportive citizens but not as uniformed members of the BSA."\nYet both Brownstein and Whitaker said they did not feel as if their decision to march in the parade was a political provocation. Both men refuse to sign an apology letter for allegedly disobeying the organization\'s rules, which may trigger the local council to revoke their memberships.\n"I am a straight scoutmaster with a wife, two children and a golden retriever so it does not impact me other than the loss to our troop of some great volunteers to the program," Brownstein told ABC News Radio.\n"What we did was carry the American flag proudly at the front of the parade; and having scouts in color guards in parades is as American as apple pie," Brownstein told ABC News\' Salt Lake City affiliate KTVX-TV.\n"We weren\'t rallying for a politician or political event," Whitaker told The Salt Lake Tribune. "To me, it was being supportive of my fellow human beings."\nThe decision to march in the Utah Pride Parade came just a month after the Boy Scouts of America lifted the ban on gay members. The organization still has a ban on gay adults serving as Scout leaders.\nThe group that Brownstein and Whitaker were a part of spanned in age from a retired scoutmaster in his mid-50s to a 9-year-old scout from a neighboring town, Brownstein told ABC News Radio. While some marchers wore their uniforms, Brownstein said he did not.

(Updates with House floor vote in favor of bill)\nSign up for membership to become a founding member and help shape HuffPost’s next chapter\nHONOLULU, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Hawaii’s House of Representatives approved a bill on Friday to legalize same-sex marriage in the overwhelmingly Democratic state popular as a wedding and honeymoon destination, paving the way for anticipated final passage in the Senate next week.\nThe measure cleared the House in a late-night vote of 30-19, with six of the chamber’s seven Republicans joining 13 Democrats in opposing the legislation. Two Democrats were absent for the vote.\nGovernor Neil Abercrombie has indicated he would swiftly sign the measure into law, making Hawaii the 15th or 16th U.S. state to extend marriage rights to gay and lesbian couples, depending on when the governor of Illinois signs that state’s bill.\nAs currently drafted, the Hawaii bill would take effect on Dec. 2.\n“This is about a move toward acceptance, tolerance and compassion,” Representative Sylvia Luke, chairwoman of the House Finance Committee, said as the House floor debate began hours before the vote.\nThe vote in Hawaii comes at a time of increasing momentum for gay marriage in the courts, at the ballot box and statehouses across the country.\nHawaii’s Supreme Court ruled two decades ago that banning same-sex marriage was discriminatory, helping to advance gay rights nationwide but also sparking a backlash that kept the legislature passing a bill on the issue.\nWith public opinion shifting, Abercrombie, a first-term Democrat, called the state legislature into special session late last month to consider a bill that rolls back a 1994 statute defining marriage as between a man and a woman only.\nThe Senate overwhelmingly approved the measure last Wednesday, with a 20-4 vote. Three Democrats joined the state’s only Republican senator in voting against the bill.\nBecause the measure was amended in the House, it must return to the Senate for final adoption. The Senate is precluded by legislative rules from acting before next Tuesday, aides say.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Clayton Hee was quoted in the Honolulu Star Advertiser as saying he expected the Senate would accept the House version quickly.\nGAY RIGHTS VS. RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\nAbercrombie, who served more than two decades in the U.S. House of Representatives before running for governor in 2010, signed a same-sex civil unions bill into law two years ago. His predecessor, Republican Linda Lingle, vetoed a civil unions bill in 2010.\nThe governor has said the proposal was crafted to address opponents’ concerns that legalizing gay marriage would infringe on religious freedoms. The proposal exempts clergy and churches from having to perform same-sex marriages.\nOnly six states and the District of Columbia recognized same-sex marriage a year ago, but the number has since more than doubled, due in most cases to litigation over the issue.\nThree states - Maine, Maryland and Washington - became the first to extend marriage rights to same-sex couples by popular vote with passage of ballot initiatives last November.\nLast month, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie dropped his legal opposition to gay marriage, making his state the 14th to legalize same-sex weddings.\nIllinois, whose legislature gave final approval to a same-sex marriage bill on Tuesday, would become the 15th state, unless Abercrombie manages to beat Illinois Governor Pat Quinn to the punch.

This is a common refrain in right-wing circles these days:\nScanning national media over the last several days, one sees words such as homophobia, bigotry and xenophobia thrown like confetti by liberals at anyone who dare say that under the federal constitution, states have the right to define marriage. These scare tactics are actually working—Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, felt compelled to appear on national TV and explain that Catholic religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman forever, to create life is not bigotry but a religious teaching. The left's response—not enough. Nothing is enough short of changing religious doctrine to fit the beliefs of the liberal masses.\nThis is driving the wingers to distraction. Theirs is an entire movement built on the politics of resentment, from the racist Southern Strategy to anti-gay ballot initiatives. Now those roosters are coming home to roost, and the damage inflicted is incalculable.\nWe liberals always knew modern conservatism was (literally) built on racial resentment, from the day the Republican Party accepted the Dixiecrats with open arms. But that brand is seeping into the broader mainstream. I keep going back to this GOP focus group in Ohio after the 2012 election, where young working-class white voters expressed dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama and the Democrats, but were just vicious in their assessment of the GOP:\nNone of them expressed great enthusiasm for Obama. But their depiction of Republicans was even more lacerating than the women’s had been. “Racist,” “out of touch” and “hateful” made the list — “and put ‘1950s’ on there too!” one called out.\nRemember, those aren't liberals, but the kind of white working-class swing-state voters Republicans need to attract to offset their growing disadvantages with non-Anglo voters. But few want to vote for a racist, hateful, out-of-touch party straight out of the 1950s.\nThat's why you'll now see the bigots spend half their time arguing that they're not bigots and don't really hate gay people, it's just that they can't tolerate something consenting adults are doing so fuck them and their rights. See? It's not bigotry. It's just intolerance, which is totally different than bigotry!\nThe mask is off the modern GOP, and all the whining and revisionism can't change the fact that America sees them for the hateful paranoid bigoted xenophobes that they are. And if that hurts their chances at winning elections? It just means that sometimes, there really is justice in this world.

lockquote>\n<p>There is apparently a rumor that Chan is planning a run for Mayor in 2015, which she wouldn\'t confirm or deny. Right. We\'ll see how that goes for her.</p>', 'text': 'A proposed non-discrimination ordinance in San Antonio barring discrimination against LGBT people has been a source of considerable controversy as of late. Right-wing individuals and groups have predictably smeared the proposal and tried to whip up fear and make it out to be "anti-religion." And now, the plot thickens, as Republican Councilwoman Elisa Chan has been outed by a former staffer as an outright homophobe.\nJames Stevens, who served as an aide to Chan, has resigned this week, but he\'s going out with a bang. Unbeknownst to Chan and the other staffers, he had recorded a private meeting from May 21 about the ordinance on his iPhone. What the recording reveals, other than the fact that Chan is an idiot and had some idiots working for her, is a rather appalling anti-gay conversation between Chan and her staffers. During the course of the conversation, one of her staffers brings up incest and bestiality and Chan herself calls homosexuality disgusting and says that gay people should not be allowed to adopt. Some pretty extreme homophobia on display.\nI\'m going to embed the 15-minute recording below, which you should listen to if you have the stomach. But here are some of Chan\'s "gems" extracted by the San Antonio Express-News:\nBy the way, this is politically incorrect. I don’t think homosexual people should do adoption. They should be banned by adoption. You’re going to confuse those kids. They should be banned.\nIf you wanted to choose that lifestyle, we don’t want to discriminate you, but you shouldn’t affect the young people. How terrible. … They’re going to be confused. You see two men go into a bedroom. You see two women kissing. Is that not confusing? It’s confusing.\nIt is actually, what you call, suggestive, for the kids to be corrupt, which is against nature. I’m telling you, anything that is against nature is not right.\nYou know, to be quite honest, I know this is not politically correct. I never bought in that you are born, that you are born gay. I can’t imagine it.\nWhen I say that it’s … behavioral preference, they say that, "No, you’re born with it." But I never bought into that.\nI think it’s just disgusting just to even think about.\nPerhaps even more interesting is how far she\'s willing to go to cover up her obviously antiquated views from the public.\nIn strategizing on how to oppose the anti-discrimination ordinance, Chan decided to have her staff draft an op-ed to appear in a local paper.\n“Can you guys come up with a draft?” she asks her aides. “Come up with draft with all the good, those arguments we talk as a speaking point, in terms of we’re addressing an issue that is not an issue. This is national politics again at the council level.\n“This is another layer of bureaucracy, that we have not heard any discrimination,” she continues. “And then add in the family value in there. … Maybe I’ll use the industries, that we have a trend, that is, maybe I’ll use we have water rates and CPS rates to worry about.”\n“Maybe what we can do, can we maybe throw some questionable confusions like, OK, this ‘transgender,’ because the definition is so broad…”\nListen to the horrifying recording yourself:\nChan\'s then-chief of policy Jeff Bazan is the one on the recording who warns that we\'re on a slippery slope toward incest and bestiality (how original, right?) and tells Chan to be a "culture warrior" on the issue. Well, he\'s now working for pro-gay Democrat Ron Nirenberg, who was just elected to the City Council, as his chief of staff. Can somebody say awkward? Bazan released the following statement yesterday:\nI was basically explaining the viewpoint that some people have on the gay marriage issue. What I said was wrong and I deeply regret it. I can say that those comments, which were intended to be purely political, do not reflect my heart. Councilman Nirenberg, whom I currently serve and support, has made it clear that discrimination is not negotiable, and I am proud to work for him.\nRight.\nAs for Chan, she acted as if she didn\'t know Stevens at first when confronted about the recording. Then she had this to say:\nI think that\'s in a private setting and I don\'t know if that\'s — I need to hear that recording to know. I\'m not quite sure what you\'re talking about so maybe you can play that back to me. We talk a lot of things in the staff meetings, so I wanted to know also under what context.\nThere is apparently a rumor that Chan is planning a run for Mayor in 2015, which she wouldn\'t confirm or deny. Right. We\'ll see how that goes for her.

Peers have spent several hours debating whether to "wreck" the government\'s plans to bring in same sex-marriage, ahead of a crucial vote on Tuesday.\nThe bill, covering England and Wales, was backed by the Commons with a 205 majority, despite 161 MPs opposing it.\nEx-chief constable Lord Dear, who has tabled the amendment aimed at stopping it proceeding any further, called the proposals "ill-considered".\nBut the government said everyone should have the right to marry.\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury said he had "considerable hesitations" about the plan.\nThe Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill for England and Wales would allow couples who can currently form civil partnerships to marry.\nThe debate started early on Monday afternoon and is due to continue on Tuesday, with a vote expected at about 1900 BST.\n\'Deep concern\'\nIf the bill passes, religious organisations would have to "opt in" to offering weddings, with the Church of England and Church in Wales being banned in law from doing so.\nIt is backed by Prime Minister David Cameron, his Liberal Democrat deputy Nick Clegg and Labour leader Ed Miliband - 366 MPs voted in favour in the free vote in the Commons,\nIt is alienating much of our core support while failing to attract new voters with under two years to go before the general electionLetter from Conservative Grassroots group\nThe bill, which has been criticised by Conservative activists, is expected to face a tough passage through the Lords. If crossbench peer Lord Dear\'s amendment, aimed at preventing the legislation getting a second reading, were passed, it would effectively kill it.\nThe former chief constable of West Midlands Police told peers the bill was "ill-considered" and sought to "overturn centuries of tradition".\nIt was "blind to the laws of unintended consequences", he added, calling homosexuals "a very small minority".\nLord Dear also said: "The concept should be sent back to the drawing board. This is too serious a matter to be hurried through on a whim and in a cavalier fashion."\nBut equalities minister Baroness Stowell of Beeston said: "For gay and lesbian couples this matters. It matters because it means the final acceptance of who they are."\nShe added that discrimination against homosexuals was "wrong" and that "no religion or faith would be required to change its beliefs or doctrines" as a result of the bill.\nSame-sex marriage was "new and different" but would "not affect the nature of existing marriage", Lady Beeston said.\nBaroness Royall, Labour\'s leader in the Lords, said she understood the bill had caused "anguish" for some people of faith, but she did not understand the argument that gay marriage could "harm marriage between a man and a woman".\n\'Not discrimination\'\nBut the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, told the Lords the plans would "weaken" existing marriage, adding that ministers were confusing "equality" with "uniformity".\nHe added: "I and many of my colleagues retain considerable hesitations about this bill."\nConservative former cabinet minister Lord Tebbit: "This bill is promoted as a measure to end discrimination against homosexuals, but the present law of marriage does not discriminate against homosexuals.\n"The rights of a homosexual man are identical to mine. Subject to the laws on incest and bigamy, we are both free to marry a woman. Neither he nor I may marry another man. Our positions are identical."\nAnd Labour\'s Lord Anderson of Swansea challenged Mr Cameron to hold a referendum on the issue, saying: "Surely this proposed change is far more fundamental to our society than any transfer of power to Brussels."\nHe said the prime minister "and his friends can put their case", but added that "many of us - Conservatives, Labour and crossbenchers - will be on the other side. Let the people decide."\nSome 86 peers are expected to speak in the debate with a final vote due on Tuesday evening.\nThe Conservative Grassroots group has called on peers to reject the bill, but Mr Cameron hopes it will become law soon and that the first ceremonies can take place by next summer.\nThe Scottish government has confirmed it will introduce a bill shortly to allow same-sex marriage.

The justices of the Supreme Court are keeping Americans in suspense as the nation awaits what could be landmark decisions on same-sex marriage and a range of other important issues with just weeks to go in their current session.\nThe US Supreme Court prepares to enter June with the term\'s biggest cases yet to be decided. NBC\'s Pete Williams looks at what\'s left on the docket.\nCan a state limit marriage to the traditional one man-one woman couple, as California did in 2008? Does the U.S. Constitution guarantee same-sex couples a right to marry – a right which supersedes any state law?\nAnd in a second case, the court will decide whether in awarding federal benefits and deciding federal tax policy, the government must recognize the same-sex couples who’ve been married in one of the states that now permit such marriages.\nThe justices may decide those questions before they conclude their work for the 2012-13 term in the next several weeks. They could find ways to avoid a definitive ruling on each question, but that scenario doesn’t lessen the suspense.\nBut the marriage decisions are just the high point of a series of marquee cases the court will decide in the coming weeks. Here are the other cases worth watching:\nScope of the Voting Rights Act: Shelby County, Ala., has asked the court to find that Congress exceeded its power when it renewed key sections of the law in 2006.\nUnder Section 5 of the law, nine states, as well as dozens of counties, cities and elected boards in other states, must seek permission from the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington for any change in voting procedures that they seek to make.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif.,speaks during a rally outside the Supreme Court in Washington, Wednesday, Feb. 27, 2013, before arguments in the Shelby County, Ala., v. Holder voting rights case.\nShelby County contends that the formula used to determine which states are covered by Section 5 is outdated, based on voter turnout and registration data dating from 1972.\nBut Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said that without Section 5, election officials could cause “great mischief,” by, for example, making changes in polling place locations at the last minute before an election.\nIf a majority of the justices agree with Shelby County, it will mark a significant change in the way the federal government enforces voting rights.\nBut a separate section of the Voting Rights Act -- not at issue in this case -- gives the federal government full power to take action against discriminatory voting practices in all 50 states.\nCitizenship and voter registration:In another case involving voting, the justices will decide the fate of an Arizona law which requires people to provide proof of American citizenship in order to register to vote.\nAt issue is whether the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, intended to make voter registration easier, takes precedence over the Arizona law.\nArizona contends that in enacting the citizenship requirement its citizens were responding to legitimate concerns about fraud in voter registration, including some cases in which foreign citizens admitted that they had registered to vote in Arizona.\nThe pending decision will be significant in marking the limit of what states can do on their own to regulate who registers and who gets to vote.\nRacial preferences in university admissions: In a case which will have wide reverberations in colleges and universities across the nation, the high court will decide a challenge brought by Abigail Fisher, an applicant to the University of Texas who was denied admission to the university’s entering class in 2008.\nFisher alleges that using racial preferences in admissions violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.\nThe university defends its admissions program, saying it used race as a factor because its student body had not yet reached a “critical mass” of African-Americans and Latinos.\nA decision in favor of Fisher would mean that a majority of the court had decided that the time had come to end the experiment in the use of racial preferences in state universities that the high court first approved 35 years ago.\nGetting DNA samples from arrestees:Does the Fourth Amendment -- which prohibits "unreasonable searches and seizures" -- allow states to collect and analyze DNA from people arrested and charged with serious crimes –- even if they haven’t yet been convicted?\nIn 2008, the Maryland legislature required police to collect a DNA sample from anyone arrested for crimes of violence and burglary, or attempts to commit those crimes. Alonzo King, arrested in 2009 for assault, had his DNA sample taken by a cheek swab; that sample was later used to help convict him of a 2003 rape that had gone unsolved.\nKing challenged that conviction arguing that a DNA cheek swab is a search and is “an intrusion into the person” which is not permitted without a warrant and without “some level of individualized suspicion.”\nThe Obama administration sided with the state of Maryland in this case. Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben argued before the high court that a DNA sample was justified because “an arrestee is someone whose conduct has given rise to probable cause that he committed a crime, he\'s in a different position from ordinary citizens.”\nThe decision in this case will show how the current majority on the court balances individual rights, especially the right to one\'s own genetic information, against the imperatives of tracking down criminals using all the technologies that science can offer.\nThis story was originally published on Wed May 29, 2013 7:29 AM E

Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben argued before the high court that a DNA sample was justified because “an arrestee is someone whose conduct has given rise to probable cause that he committed a crime, he\'s in a different position from ordinary citizens.”\nThe decision in this case will show how the current majority on the court balances individual rights, especially the right to one\'s own genetic information, against the imperatives of tracking down criminals using all the technologies that science can offer.\nThis story was originally published on Wed May 29, 2013 7:29 AM E

USATODAY\nA federal judge has ruled that gay marriages may continue in Utah\nJudge Richard Shelby on Monday denied a request by the state of Utah to halt the weddings pending appeal\nUtah is expected to ask a higher court to put the process on hold\nA federal judge has ruled that gay marriage in Utah may continue, making Utah the 18th state in addition to the District of Columbia where gay and lesbian couples can marry.\nJudge Richard Shelby on Monday denied a request by the state that sought to halt gay marriage until the appeals process plays out.\nCouples on Monday waited to marry in lines that at times stretched for blocks outside the Salt Lake City County Government Center. Some had spent the night in their cars in the parking lot to make sure they didn\'t miss their chance.\nWell-wishers arrived with flowers, coffee and doughnuts to give to the brides and grooms waiting in the chill morning air. At midmorning a group of Christmas carolers arrived to serenade them.\nFor now, a state considered as one of the most conservative in the nation has joined the likes of California and New York to become the 18th where same-sex couples can legally wed.\nUtah is home to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was one of the leading forces behind California\'s short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8, which voters approved in 2008. The church said Friday that it stands by its support for "traditional marriage" and that it hopes a higher court validates its belief that marriage is between a man and woman.\nThe state Office of the Attorney General appealed to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver to have Shelby\'s ruling stayed just after it was issued, said spokesman Ryan Bruckman in Salt Lake City.\nThe marriages will continue until the appeal is either upheld or denied, he said.\nThe decision drew a swift and angry reaction from Republican Gov. Gary Herbert, who said he was disappointed in an "activist federal judge attempting to override the will of the people of Utah."\nGay couples began lining up to marry on Friday when Shelby overturned Utah\'s ban on same-sex marriage, ruling it is unconstitutional. Lines continued to be out the door in many areas as couples raced to get married for fear a stay might be issued and the wedding ended.\nJolene Abbott, 39, and her wife, Colleen Mewing, 51, were married in July in Washington State. But they got married in Salt Lake City Monday afternoon just to make extra sure they were well and truly married in their home state.\n"An attorney friend of ours told us that if the appeal goes through they might still recognize the marriages that have occurred in Utah so far, but couples married outside of the state might not be recognized," she said of their decision to marry for a second time.\nUtah\'s Bruckman doesn\'t think that is correct but he\'s not sure. "It\'s the million dollar question. We\'re in a state of flux, where Amendment 3 (which bans same sex marriage in Utah) is the law and is not the law."\n"We don\'t have a timetable on this," Bruckman said.\nRetired Utah state representative Jackie Biskupski was at the Government Center officiating at weddings on Monday. "I\'ve done about ten today. The clerks are issuing about 45 licenses an hour and there are over 50 ministers in the building to marry people."\nShe believes that gay couples who are legally married elsewhere but live in Utah "need to get married in Utah to have that marriage recognized here."\nSome county clerks are refusing to issue licenses to same sex couples. Other have "elected, for safety\'s sake, to not give out any marriage licenses at all until we know what we\'re required to do," said Bruckman.\nGroups advocating for same sex marriage expressed pleasure at Shelby\'s ruling.\n"We\'re thrilled that this decision continues the process of decisions across the country that support the right of gay and lesbian couples to get married and have their love and families protected equally under the law," said Brian Silva, executive director of Marriage Equality. The New York City-based group promotes the rights of gay and lesbian couples to marry.\nThe 53-page ruling said the constitutional amendment Utah voters approved in 2004 violates gay and lesbian couples\' rights to due process and equal protection under the 14th Amendment. Shelby said the state failed to show that allowing same-sex marriages would affect opposite-sex marriages in any way.\nThe ruling has thrust Shelby into the national spotlight. He has been on the bench for less than two years, appointed by President Obama after GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch recommended him in November 2011.\nShelby served in the Utah Army National Guard from 1988 to 1996 and was a combat engineer in Operation Desert Storm. He graduated from the University of Virginia law school in 1998 and clerked for the U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Greene in Utah, then spent about 12 years in private practice before he became a judge.\nContributing: The Associated Press

The Alliance Party leader David Ford has compared the current debate over equal marriage legislation to the civil rights campaign 50 years ago in Northern Ireland.\nEarlier this month Mr Ford stepped aside as an elder at Second Donegore Presbyterian Church over his political support for gay marriage.\nHis position on the issue is to be examined by the church.\nMr Ford said the language of the debate was important.\n"I think it\'s not for majorities to tell minorities that feel discriminated against that they\'re not being discriminated against," he told the BBC\'s Sunday Sequence.\n"I think you only have to look back at the history of this region in the 1950s and 60s to see the dangers of majorities telling minorities that discrimination isn\'t real."\nLast September, the Alliance Party voted in support of legislation to allow gay civil marriage in Northern Ireland.\nMr Ford voluntarily stepped aside as an elder in Second Donegore Presbyterian Church after some members of the congregation expressed concerns about his support for marriage equality laws.\n"It appeared my political position was a focus for some limited dissent within the congregation," he said.\n"I\'m not sure how many members of the congregation did go to the minister.\n"I know there were a small number who had a conversation with the minister and I\'ve had conversations both, in the presbytery and in the session, before I voluntarily stepped aside, just to be very clear, currently from the active duties of the office, not from the office.\n"I think that is very much an issue which is in the hands of the session of Second Donegore as to whether or when they might wish me to resume those duties."\nMr Ford told the programme it had been a "difficult time for me and my family given the way the controversy has raged and given to some extent the way it\'s been handled in the media".\nThe Alliance Party supports same sex marriage in Northern Ireland, while the Presbyterian church strongly opposes the move.\nMr Ford said his personal position on same sex marriage was the same as the party\'s position.\n"I believe the state has a duty to provide services for citizens on an equal basis, and at the same time, the state has a duty to protect the rights of churches to define and practice their own beliefs," he said.

Today is the 46th anniversary of Loving v. Virginia, the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that declared unconstitutional any ban on interracial marriage. More than four decades after the historic and aptly named Loving decision, the U.S. Supreme Court is once again poised to rule in a case that could put an end to discriminatory bans prohibiting marriage, this time for gay and lesbian couples.\nThis month, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in a decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry, a case brought by two California couples challenging the constitutionality of the state\'s ban on same sex marriages, commonly called Prop 8. Attorneys Ted Olson and David Boies -- a Republican and Democrat best known for battling each other before the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore -- have teamed up and taken the Perry case beyond California.\nOlson and Boies argued before the justices that the Supreme Court has the obligation under the Constitution to strike down not just Prop 8, but all state laws banning marriage equality for gay and lesbian Americans. After all, they say, this is precisely how the court ruled in Loving -- and 13 other cases dating back to 1888 in which a majority of the justices stood up to protect the fundamental right of every American to marry the person he or she loves.\nA broad ruling in the Perry case this month would be a historic step forward in affirming that gay Americans are entitled to the same rights and freedoms as everyone else. Although I firmly believe public opinion is irrelevant to the court\'s responsibility to ensure equality under the law, our nation is clearly ready to embrace marriage equality.\nWhen the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in 1967, a Gallup poll found that only 20% of Americans approved of such marriages. But the court fulfilled its duty to protect individual rights without regard to what was popular.\nToday, we have already have evolved much further on marriage equality. A growing bipartisan majority of voters -- 58% -- support marriage rights for same-sex couples.\nWhen Richard Loving told his lawyer to "tell the court I love my wife," he could not have known that his words would still be applicable 46 years later in the very same courtroom. There is never a wrong time to stand up for justice and equality, but the time has never been more right to stand up for gay rights than in the Perry case.\nAs the Supreme Court weighs equality for gay and lesbian couples, the anniversary of Loving provides a timely reminder of a new legacy they could write for the history books.

Many thousands more on the sidewalks — the police crowd estimate of more than 1 million made it the best-attended Chicago Pride Parade ever — were equally enthusiastic.\n"We thought we\'d never see it in our lifetime," said Bob Miezin, 64, who drove down from Milwaukee to take in the event with a longtime friend.\nMiezin recalled that being gay in the 1970s was "very secretive and secluded," a sharp contrast with Sunday\'s raucous crowd, where a mostly younger group of men and women openly celebrated their sexuality and reveled in the high court\'s rulings.\nChrissy Aupke, 18, showed up with two friends six hours before the parade began and painted a rainbow pattern over her eyelids.

All married, same-sex couples in the U.S. will receive federal tax benefits previously given to just heterosexual couples, the Obama administration said on Thursday.\nThe ruling applies even to gay couples who live in states where their union is not recognized -- so long as they were married in a state that allows same-sex marriage.\n"Today\'s ruling provides certainty and clear, coherent tax filing guidance for all legally married same-sex couples nationwide." said Secretary Jacob J. Lew in a statement. "This ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change."\nThe U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service announcement comes on the heels of the landmark Supreme Court ruling in June that said same-sex couples are entitled to federal benefits. The ruling struck down the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act that blocked federal recognition of gay marriage.\nThe ruling applies to filing status, personal and dependency exemptions, standard deduction, employee benefits, IRAs, earned income tax credits and child tax credits, according to the Treasury Department and IRS statement.\nThe ruling does not apply to those in registered domestic partnerships or civil unions.\nThirteen states and Washington, D.C., have legalized same-sex marriage as of August: California, Delaware, Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Washington, Vermont, Rhode Island, New York, Minnesota and New Hampshire.\nSeveral Native American tribes and some counties in New Mexico have also allowed marriage licenses to be issued.\nBefore Thursday\'s ruling, same-sex couples that had married had to declare themselves as "unmarried" on federal income tax forms. The Human Rights Campaign, a civil rights organization, said that cost the average same-sex couple more than $1,000 a year in additional taxes. It also meant that gay couples could not inherit property without it being taxed.\n"No family should have to worry about losing important federal rights and benefits, simply because they live in a state that doesn\'t recognize them as equal under the law," Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement.\nIn the anti-marriage camp, Brian Brown, president of National Organization for Marriage, denounced the ruling in a statement.\n"The Treasury Department is grossly overstepping its authority," Brown said. "The Obama administration is intent on forcing same-sex marriage on an unwilling public."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court delivered a landmark victory for gay rights on Wednesday by forcing the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages in states where it is legal and paving the way for it in California, the most populous state.\nAs expected, however, the court fell short of a broader ruling endorsing a fundamental right for gay people to marry, meaning that there will be no impact in the more than 30 states that do not recognize gay marriage.\nThe two cases, both decided on 5-4 votes, concerned the constitutionality of a key part of a federal law, the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), that denied benefits to same-sex married couples, and a voter-approved California state law enacted in 2008, called Proposition 8, that banned gay marriage.\nThe court struck down Section 3 of DOMA, which limited the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman for the purposes of federal benefits, as a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection under the law.\nThe ruling was a victory for President Barack Obama’s administration, which had decided two years ago it would no longer defend the law in court. Obama applauded the DOMA ruling and directed U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to review all relevant federal laws to ensure that it is implemented.\nJustice Anthony Kennedy, 76, appointed to the court by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1988, was the key vote and wrote the DOMA opinion, the third major gay rights ruling he has authored since 1996.\nIn a separate opinion, the court ducked a decision on Proposition 8 by finding that supporters of the California law did not have standing to appeal a federal district court ruling that struck it down. By doing so, the justices let stand the lower-court ruling that had found the ban unconstitutional.\nChief Justice John Roberts wrote the Proposition 8 opinion, ruling along procedural lines in a way that said nothing about how the court would rule on the merits. The court was unusually split, with liberals and conservatives in both the majority and the dissent.\nBy ruling this way on Proposition 8, the court effectively let states set their own policy on gay marriage. This means a debate is set to continue in various states via ballot initiatives, legislative action and litigation potentially costing millions of dollars on both sides of an issue that stirs cultural, religious and political passions in the United States as elsewhere.\nThe rulings come amid rapid progress for advocates of gay marriage in recent months and years. Opinion polls show a steady increase in U.S. public support for gay marriage.\n‘SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS’\nGay marriage advocates celebrated outside the courthouse. A big cheer went up as word arrived DOMA had been struck down. “DOMA is dead!” the crowd chanted, as couples hugged and cried.\nPaul Katami and Jeffrey Zarrillo, a gay couple from Burbank, California, who were two of the four plaintiffs in the Proposition 8 case, were both outside the courthouse.\n“We are gay. We are American. And we will not be treated like second-class citizens,” Katami said.\nHe turned to Zarrillo, voice cracking and said: “I finally get to look at the man I love and say, ‘Will you marry me?’”\nBefore Wednesday, 12 of the 50 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia recognized gay marriage. Three of those dozen - Delaware, Minnesota and Rhode Island - legalized gay marriage this year. California would become the 13th state to allow it.\nMarried couple Bill Hacket, 53, (L) and Thom Uber hold hands in West Hollywood, California after the United States Supreme court ruled on California's Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act, June 26, 2013. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\nAbout a third of the U.S. population now lives in areas where gay marriage is legal, if California is included.\n“We are a people who declared that we are all created equal, and the love we commit to one another must be equal as well,” Obama, the first sitting president to endorse gay marriage, said in a written statement.\nWhile the ruling on DOMA was clearcut, questions remained about the meaning of the Proposition 8 ruling for California. Proposition 8 supporters vowed to seek continued enforcement of the ban until litigation is resolved. But California Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, said the justices’ ruling “applies statewide” and all county officials must comply with it.\n“We are now faced with this unusual situation where we have some uncertainty,” said Andrew Pugno, one of the Proposition 8 proponents’ lawyers. He expressed satisfaction that the Supreme Court had “nullified” a San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that, if left intact, could have had set a precedent for other Western states in its jurisdiction.\nFEDERAL BENEFITS\nBy striking down Section 3 of DOMA, the court cleared the way for legally married couples to claim more than 1,100 federal benefits, rights and burdens linked to marriage status.\nKennedy wrote for the majority that the federal law, as passed by Congress, violated the U.S. Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. “The federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the state, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity,” Kennedy wrote.\nThe law imposed “a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the states,” he said.\nRoberts and Justice Antonin Scalia both wrote dissenting opinions in the DOMA case.\nRoberts went out of his way to state that the court was not making any big pronouncements about gay marriage. The court, he said, did not have before it the question of whether states “may continue to utilize the traditional definition of marriage.”\nScalia accused the majority of ignoring procedural obstacles about whether the court should have heard the case in order to reach its desired result.\n“This is jaw-dropping,” he said of Kennedy’s analysis.\nSlideshow (18 Images)\nAs a result of the DOMA ruling, Edith Windsor of New York, who was married to a woman and sued the government to get the federal estate tax deduction available to heterosexuals when their spouses die, will be able to claim a $363,000 tax refund.\nThe ruling was a win also for more than 200 businesses, including Goldman Sachs Group, Microsoft Corp and Google Inc, that signed on to a brief urging the court to strike down DOMA. Thomson Reuters Corp, owner of the Reuters news agency, was another signatory.\n“Today’s decisions help define who we are as a people, whether or not we are part of the group directly affected,” said Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman’s chief executive.\nCHANGING LANDSCAPE\nNumerous public figures including former President Bill Clinton, who in 1996 signed the DOMA law, and prominent groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics have come out this year in support of same-sex marriage and gay civil rights.\nIndividual members of Congress - Democrats and Republicans - also voiced new support for gay marriage this year.\nEven with recent developments, there is still significant opposition among Republicans, including House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, who had ordered the House to intervene in the DOMA case in defense of the law. Boehner said in a statement he was “obviously disappointed in the ruling” and predicted that a “robust national debate over marriage” would continue.\nWhile more developments lie ahead, the legal fight over gay marriage already constitutes one of the most concentrated civil rights sagas in U.S. history.\nJust 20 years ago, the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that its state constitution could allow gay marriage, prompting a nationwide backlash and spurring Congress and a majority of states, including Hawaii, to pass laws defining marriage as between only a man and woman.\nIn 2003, when the top court of Massachusetts established a right to same-sex marriage under its constitution, the action triggered another backlash as states then adopted constitutional amendments against such unions. Five years later, the tide began to reverse, and states slowly began joining Massachusetts in permitting gays to marry.\nThe cases are United States v. Windsor, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 12-307 and Hollingsworth v. Perry, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 12-144.\nAdditional reporting by Joseph Ax, Steve Holland and Roberta Rampton in Washington, Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York and Daniel Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Howard Goller and Will Dunham

Legislation to enable same-sex marriages to take place in England and Wales has been published.\nCulture Secretary Maria Miller told BBC Radio 4: "We feel that marriage is a good thing and we should be supporting more couples to marry."\nThere would be adequate protection for religious freedoms, she said.\nThe bill has divided Conservatives, with former Defence Secretary Liam Fox recently describing it as "ill thought through and constitutionally wrong".\nConservative MPs will get a free vote on the legislation when it is debated in the Commons on Tuesday 5 February, meaning they will face no repercussions if they decide to defy government policy.\nMore than 100 Tory MPs are thought to be against the idea, but the bill is likely to pass through the Commons with the support of Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs.\nSame-sex couples have been able to enter into civil partnerships since 2005, entitling them to the same legal rights as married couples across a range of matters, such as inheritance, pensions provision, life assurance, child maintenance, next of kin and immigration rights.\n\'Special case\'\nThe new law, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, will enable same-sex couples to get married in both civil and religious ceremonies - where a religious institution has formally consented.\nThe legislation looks as though it was made on the hoof to deal with the political problem du jourLiam Fox, Conservative MP and former Defence Secretary\nIt will also allow couples who have previously entered into civil partnerships to convert their relationship into a marriage.\nMrs Miller said the government recognised that "some churches won\'t want to participate in same-sex marriages".\n"We are trying to make sure that there are the protections there for churches who feel that this isn\'t appropriate for their particular beliefs," she told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme.\nHowever, the government also wanted any religious institution that did want to carry out same-sex marriages to be able to do so, she said.\nThe Church of England and Roman Catholics, among other denominations, have voiced opposition to the plans and are expected to oppose the bill, even with its caveats.\nBut some religious groups, including Quakers, Unitarians and Liberal Judaism, are in favour.\nThe culture secretary set out the legal position of the Church of England and the Church in Wales in some detail in a blog post in December.\n"The Church of England, as the established church, is a special case. It has a duty in law to marry any person in their local parish church, regardless of their religious affiliation," she wrote.\nThe legislation would ensure this duty did not apply to same-sex couples, she said.\n\'Christians under threat\'\nBut she added that it could put forward a change to the law "of its own accord" if its governing body, the Synod, changed its policy: "Put simply, should the Church of England decide to carry out same-sex marriage in the future, it can itself amend legislation to effect this with the approval of Parliament."\nMrs Miller told the Commons in December that no religious organisation "will ever be forced to conduct marriages for same-sex couples".\nMr Fox has said the proposals will put the established church in an "anomalous and absurd" position.\nIn a letter to constituents that was made public earlier this month, Mr Fox said same-sex relationships should be treated "with tolerance and respect", but he did not believe there was much demand for them to be recognised as marriages.\n"The legislation looks as though it was made on the hoof to deal with the political problem du jour," he wrote.\nThe government was in danger of "further weakening and splintering Britain\'s traditional religion at a time when many Christians feel that they are under threat", he said.\n"To fail to understand this is to risk an affront to a large stabilising and normally acquiescent section of this country which will sow completely unnecessary seeds of dissent."\nThe Bishop of Leicester, the Right Reverend Tim Stevens, said marriage should continue to be "a union between one man and one woman. It is a social institution that predates both church and state and has been part of the glue that has bound countless successive societies together."\nThe "absence of an overwhelming public consensus for change ought at least to give pause for thought", he said.\nBut John Wadham, general counsel at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, welcomed the move: "We agree that couples who wish to marry should be permitted to marry in church if their church also wishes to marry them."\nFor Labour, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: "Marriage as an institution has undergone repeated reform and modernisation over hundreds of years and needs to again now to reflect the equal value we place on long-term loving relationships for same-sex couples too."

Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan showed Wednesday that in 1996, the House passed the Defense of Marriage Act not to gently respect tradition but "to express moral disapproval of homosexuality." Paul Clement, the law\'s defender in court, tried to claim that\'s not so, but the more you look at the origins of DOMA, the more you realize that there is no way a law conceived so directly out of hatred can represent anything but hatred. DOMA didn\'t originate in the House, GLAAD reminds us. Rather, it came out of a coalition of hard-right groups like the Family Research Council, and from there to Congress. Current FRC head Tony Perkins explains:\nBack in 1995, a group of individuals, including Don Wildmon, met in Memphis, Tennessee, because of what had happened in Hawaii where the court imposed same-sex marriage. Of course the folks there pushed back in the state of Hawaii. But then there was a concern that this could happen across the country. And so a group of leaders met in Memphis, Tennessee, and talked about the need to solidify marriage and by preventing states from imposing definition of marriage on the states. So the concept of the Defense of Marriage Act—wasn\'t called that at the time—originated, and actually we took it back to our policy shop at FRC and formulated the policy and actually gave it the name Defense of Marriage Act.\nThe rollout of DOMA included Peter LaBarbera, who likes to talk about "homo-fascism" and has said "We need to stop conceding the moral high ground in a fearful bid to appear \'tolerant,\'" and Robert Knight, who just this week wrote that "the left’s drive for \'gay rights\' poses the greatest domestic threat to the freedoms of religion, speech and assembly." It included a C-SPAN-televised FRC briefing for Capitol Hill staff at which Knight claimed that:\nIf you are a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim, or just believe that homosexuality is wrong, and the law gives homosexuality protected status, then your personal beliefs are now outside civil law. The entire civil rights apparatus can be brought against you. Businessmen will have to subsidize homosexuality or face legal sanction; schoolchildren will have to be taught that homosexuality is equivalent to marital love.\nAt the same briefing, another "expert" argued that "Every argument for gay marriage is an argument that would support polygamy." That same person argued, on another occasion, that the Supreme Court\'s Romer v. Evans decision that states can\'t ban anti-discrimination laws was a terrible, terrible thing because making it illegal to discriminate against gay people is in effect discriminating against bigots (or, as he put it, religious people).\nThis was the origination and the push for DOMA. There is no way to disguise it as anything but hate. And there is no way to seriously claim that in the not quite 17 years since the law\'s passage it has miraculously transmuted from hate to ... whatever Paul Clement is now claiming with his repeated invocations of the law as "rational."

More\nA majority of Supreme Court justices expressed concern Wednesday about a federal law that bars same sex marriage, signaling the nation\'s highest court may be poised to extend a potentially historic victory to the gay rights movement.\nHearing arguments in the second of two major gay marriage cases over two days, the probing questions from both wings of the court suggest the Defense of Marriage Act, which bars the federal government from recognizing same sex marriage in states where it is legal, could be struck down. Such a decision would be breakthrough for supporters of same sex nuptials, who until now have measured progress at a state by state level.\nBut the fundamental question of whether gay couples can marry in the U.S. will most likely not be settled by the court this time. Striking down DOMA would likely benefit only married same sex couples in the nine states (and the District of Columbia) where their marriages are legal. And a day earlier, justices hinted they might toss a challenge to Prop 8, a California law banning gay marriage, on procedural grounds.\nJustices across the spectrum Wednesday seemed troubled by DOMA, which was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996. Clinton has since announced his opposition to the law.\nThe court\'s conservative leaning justices asked pointed questions about whether the law was anti-federalist, since it intrudes into states\' traditional right to regulate marriage. The more liberal justices seemed amenable to the argument that DOMA discriminates against gay people and was passed with the clear intention of excluding an unpopular group.\nJustices could strike down the law in a narrow way that would force the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages only in states where it\'s already allowed. There\'s a chance the court could rule more broadly, making dozens of state gay marriage bans legally vulnerable. Such an expansive ruling from the court is considered much less likely.\nThe Justice Department would typically defend a federal law being challenged in the Supreme Court, but he Obama administration has declined to do so because it believes it is unconstitutional. Paul Clement, an attorney chosen by House Republicans who support DOMA, defended it instead.\nJustice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative-leaning swing vote who has written two landmark opinions affirming gay rights, seemed unconvinced by the argument advanced by Clement that DOMA defines marriage as only between opposite-sex couples to avoid confusion. Clement said that the federal government has an interest in "uniformity," and had passed the law to avoid having to treat same-sex couples differently based on whether they live in states that allow gay marriage or not.\nKennedy pointed out that DOMA excludes married same-sex couples in more than 1,100 federal statutes and laws, which has a substantial impact on the "day to day life" of those couples and their children. He said the law does not provide uniformity because it affects "only one aspect of marriage."\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said excluding married gay couples from sick leave, tax benefits, Social Security survivor benefits, and hundreds of other federal benefits and obligations, relegates same-sex couples to a "skim milk marriage" that is substantially worse than what heterosexual couples are allowed.\nJustice Elena Kagan suggested that the law was not passed for uniformity\'s sake, but to discriminate. She read aloud from the House report on the law when it passed 17 years ago saying it expressed "moral disapproval of homosexuality."\nChief Justice John Roberts objected to the argument that Congress passed DOMA based on a dislike or hatred for gays and lesbians. He asked Attorney General Donald Verrilli, representing the Obama administration, whether he believed the 84 senators who voted for it at the time were all motivated by animus. Verrilli said the lawmakers could have voted for DOMA due to a "lack of careful reflection," but that the law discriminates no matter why it was passed.\nRoberts also objected to Attorney Roberta Kaplan\'s characterization of gay people as a disadvantaged minority group lacking political power.\n"As far as I can tell, political figures are falling over themselves to endorse your case," Roberts said.\nBut Roberts did seem concerned by the federalist argument. He, Kennedy and Justice Samuel Alito posed tough questions about whether the federal government was overreaching with the statute. Kennedy said DOMA did not seem to recognize states\'s "historical" responsibility for marriage and suggested the central question of the case is whether the federal government has the authority to regulate marriage.\nBoth attorneys arguing to strike down DOMA refused to make a federalist argument against the law, however -- instead insisting it was a discrimination case.\nBefore even getting to the merits of the case, the justices spent nearly an hour grappling with whether they should decide it at all because of procedural issues.They appointed Harvard professor Vicki Jackson to make the case that House Republicans do not have the legal right, or standing, to appeal the lower court\'s decision.\nSeveral justices were also critical of the Obama administration\'s decision to stop defending the law in court while still enforcing it. Roberts appeared to have serious doubts about the case\'s procedural issues, repeatedly saying that it is "unprecedented" for the U.S. government to appeal a case even when the parties agreed with a lower court\'s ruling.\nThe two gay marriage cases before the court this term have been dogged by procedural concerns, as both were left orphaned by public officials who no longer wanted to defend them.\nOn Tuesday, Kennedy wondered whether the court should have agreed to hear the Proposition 8 case at all. Other justices suggested they were skeptical that supporters of Proposition 8 had standing to appeal the case once California officials decided to drop it.\nIt\'s possible that neither case could end with a decision. In DOMA, that means the lower court\'s decision would stand and DOMA would be illegal in the Third Circuit. The plaintiff, Edith Windsor, would be repaid the $360,000 she had to pay in estate taxes when her wife died because the government didn\'t recognize her marriage in New York, where gay marriage is legal. In the Proposition 8 case, gay marriage would most likely become legal in California if the justices throw it out on standing or do not reach a majority.

I would trade quite a lot, in my life, for the unfathomable beauty of having national legislators who are not as dumb as burlap sacks of asbestos. Alas, however, it doesn\'t look like I\'ll ever see such a thing no matter what I were to wager, so let\'s check in on one of the nation\'s preeminent current sacks and see what they\'re up to.\nIn this case, Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-TheMatterWithKansas) is the sack, and he\'s tossing himself in the muddy river of the Washington Times because, presumably, it was the dumbest outlet he could find, with an anti-marriage-equality argument that only counts as an "argument" if you like your arguments dull, jingoistic, ankle-shallow, devoid of facts, devoid of logic and generally devoid of anything that would ever suggest the writer was a sentient, breathing thing. As we\'ve seen at the Supreme Court, however, that\'s all the "argument" we\'re going to get. The same arguments about God Says So, the same assertion that marriage is reserved for "procreation only" in spite of that never, ever seeming to come up when any of the other non-procreating people sign their names on the courthouse forms, and the same general sense that it is the bigots and the god-botherers and the people who feel icky when thinking about other people living their damn lives in peace that are the true victims in all this, because how can America survive if the biggest assholes among us do not hold holy sway over the rest?\nAll right, let\'s do this thing, or at least pieces of it. First off, the premise of the sack\'s argument is that "motherhood" is under attack. If there\'s any substantive argument to say so, hell if I can parse it out, but so sayeth the sack. That, and then some:\nFor conservatives, the concept of family is the same as the Judeo-Christian model God ordained, a model supported by every other major world religion. It is the same unit recognized by the laws of nature, the laws of government, and civilized societies for thousands of years: one man, married to one woman, with so many children as God should see fit to entrust to their care through birth or adoption. In my case, that means me, Angela (my wife of 18 years), and our four children (who happen to be adopted).\nOh, dear God, it\'s going to be one of these. For the record, there is not a damn bit of that that is not puerile fluff. Let\'s break it up, below the fold:\nFor conservatives, the concept of family is (1) the same as the Judeo-Christian model God ordained, (2) a model supported by every other major world religion. It is the same unit (3) recognized by the laws of nature, the (4) laws of government, and (5) civilized societies for thousands of years: (6) one man, married to one woman, with so many children as God should see fit to entrust to their care through birth or adoption.\n(1) Says you. (2) Except the "multiple wives" ones. (3) There is no "marriage" at all in the "laws of nature", and you have no earthly clue what the "laws of nature" even might be, and "family" in nature is the result of anything from pair bonding to harems to gang rape to ritual murder to situational hermaphroditism to the male of the species biting the female upon which his body is slowly dissolved and absorbed into the female until only only the testicles are left, so shut up about what the supposed laws of nature say we should be doing to get ourselves in a family way and (4) see (2), and (5) see (2) and (4) and a whole mess of civilized societies who thought having a young boy on the side was the purest form of love there could be and (6) I\'m just going to point out, yet a-freaking-gain, that the whole concept of "marriage" has been for nearly all of human history a question of property rights, and the spouse counted as a useful but not necessarily decisive portion of the property. I now have an absolute hatred for the sack that is Tim Huelskamp because he managed to hork up nearly every self-centered, pompous-assed non-argument used by outright morons in the span of one quick paragraph, and there really ought to be a rule saying if you do that the general citizenry at the damn least gets to put you in the official congressional Dunk Tank and start flinging balls until somebody gets lucky.\nIf that happens, the high priests and priestesses of political correctness will have done irreparable harm to yet another pillar of the American paradigm for our patriotic, wholesome culture — “God, the flag, mom and apple pie.”\nGod damn it, here we have a person honestly using "God, the flag, mom and apple pie" as the pillars of "the American paradigm," and they\'re not doing it ironically, neither the "apple pie" or the "paradigm" part. No, Tim here means it literally, and goes on to say that Bloomberg\'s soda ban and Michelle Obama\'s gentle-but-possibly-Hitlerish suggestions that our nation\'s kids get up off their fat asses every once in a while means that apple pie is under attack. This screed isn\'t an April Fool\'s prank, this is a April Fool\'s way of life, preached about by an April Fool\'s mind, taken as a holy god damn April Fool\'s sacrament.\nThe Obama administration makes the incredible assertion that motherhood is superfluous to rebut an argument that the traditional two-parent family, led by both a mother and a father, provides the ideal situation to raise a child. In defiance of biology, nature and common sense, the administration argues that children need neither a father nor a mother and that having two fathers or two mothers or more is just as good as having one of each.\nYou are an idiot, and nobody\'s arguing anything about that, and by the way you are an idiot. Do you think—and we\'re just going to explore this for one second, before my migraine ends this entire path of debate—that if we do not allow same-sex marriage, those children are suddenly going to get a mom and a dad? That there are gay couples out there who, if we deny same-sex marriage, will say, "Oh, rats, well, I guess I am now going to form a lifelong partnership with the opposite gender, which will suck for me but now my hypothetical future child will at least have appropriate biological nurturing." No. This does not happen. I hate you for thinking that this will somehow happen—that the only thing standing between every child and the one-man, one-woman parenting that a great many of them do not currently have is to deny gay Americans certain legal and tax structurings.\nGovernment, both federal and state, has a legitimate and defensible interest in ensuring that children conceived by a mother and father are, in fact, raised by their biological mothers and fathers whenever possible.\nYou, Tim Huelskamp, are a monster. Here you say that children should be raised by their biological mothers and fathers, and yet you say yourself that you\'ve adopted four of them. You are a terrible person. Those children will never know the love of a genetically related male/female pairing placed in that prime nurturing role, and I can only assume it\'s because you, you bastard, adopted them rather than letting them rot in an orphanage or on the streets where they could get a better appreciation of why it is they would want that thing.\nI don\'t even want to go through all of Huelskamp\'s drivel; it\'s all just a collection of other people\'s most vapid thoughts, dumbed down, beaten up, then put in The Sack and tossed into op-ed form. It hurts. But the main argument, such as it is, is that if we let gay marriage take place then gay people are going to somehow god damn take our god damn children and raise them in god damn non-preferentially-biological households because god damn magic, and it would be better to not allow marriage equality at all than allow that. He\'s not even talking about "gay Americans should not adopt children", which would be at least something vaguely approaching the point he roughly purports to be orbiting around, he\'s saying that the Supreme Court recognizing same-sex relationships as existing things at all is an affront to "motherhood" and "God" and, sweet Jeebus, "apple pie."\nThis. This is why I have come to thoroughly despise this entire debate. Because it is not earnest, it is not thoughtful, it is not anything but the tin-eared rantings of bigoted, dull-minded twerps who know they don\'t like same sex marriages being recognized, but can\'t rustle up so much as even the slightest actual, substantive non-God-says-so argument against the thing. God does not care what the tax status of same-sex couples is, nor do I expect the big guy on the cloud has a pressing interest in making sure a pair of people can\'t get hospital visitation or other legal rights if they don\'t have the proper combination of non-matching genitalia. Even if we were to all stipulate that a one-mom-one-dad family is better for the children than a one-mom or one-dad single-parent version in all cases, full stop, which itself is an implausible argument, you had at least better occupy yourself with explaining why you think a two-dad version has to be inferior to a single father, or a two-mom version worse than the single mom version, and not this damn generic high fructose corn syrup of arguments, this blanket assertion that if we somehow discriminate more it will result in unspecified magic in which we don\'t have single parents or foster homes or divorce or cheating spouses or broken homes or abusive parents or one bad traffic accident or teenage moms or Those Damn People Who Think Different From Me anymore.\nThis is what happens when the last blowhards in an argument know they have lost. This is what happens when all sensible people have, at long last, moved on, leaving only the dim bulbs and the lard-for-brains and the burlap sacks of discount-grade asbestos to prop up the dying cause. You get people like this guy, droning on with mealy-mouthed phrases that mean nothing, mustered for an argument that doesn\'t even make any internal sense, mustered because the only people left on the loser\'s side of the debate are people who do not give a damn whether their arguments make any sense, and all regurgitated up by whatever die-hard friendly rag has not yet evolved sufficient shame to know how silly it all looks. I will be very, very glad when these people evolve that sense of shame. Anytime now, please.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate pushed toward a historic vote on legislation outlawing workplace discrimination against gay, bisexual and transgender Americans, demonstrating the nation\'s quickly evolving attitude toward gay rights nearly two decades after Congress rejected same-sex marriage.\nAll 55 members of the Democratic majority, including senators from the Deep South, and several Republicans were expected to unite on Thursday in backing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. Sen. John McCain, the GOP\'s presidential nominee in 2008, signaled his conditional support on Wednesday.\n"It is time for Congress to pass a federal law that ensures all our citizens - regardless of where they live - can go to work unafraid to be who they are," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., who urged House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to reconsider his opposition.\nThe enthusiasm of the bill\'s supporters was tempered by the reality that the Republican-led House, where conservatives have a firm grip on the agenda, is unlikely to even vote on the legislation. Boehner maintains his longstanding opposition to the measure, arguing that it is unnecessary and certain to create costly, frivolous lawsuits for businesses. Outside conservative groups have cast the bill as anti-family.\nIn the Senate, opponents of the legislation remained mute through three days of debate, with no lawmaker speaking out. That changed on Thursday as Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana said the legislation would force employers to violate their religious beliefs, a direct counter to rights embodied in the Constitution.\n"There\'s two types of discrimination here we\'re dealing with, and one of those goes to the very fundamental right granted to every American through our Constitution, a cherished value of freedom of expression and religion," Coats said.\nThe Senate rejected an amendment sponsored by Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania that would have expanded the number of groups that are covered under the religious exemption. Opponents argued that it would undermine the core bill.

The Presidential Inauguration Committee announced Tuesday that the President Obama has selected Pastor Louie Giglio of the Georgia-based Passion City Church to deliver the benediction for his second inauguration. In a mid-1990s sermon identified as Giglio’s, available online on a Christian training Web site, he preached rabidly anti-LGBT views. The 54-minute sermon, entitled “In Search of a Standard – Christian Response to Homosexuality,” advocates for dangerous “ex-gay” therapy for gay and lesbian people, references a biblical passage often interpreted to require gay people be executed, and impels Christians to “firmly respond to the aggressive agenda” and prevent the “homosexual lifestyle”\nI can tell you that one of the most hurtful parts of the first Obama administration was asking to have Rick Warren speak at his inaugural. He was giving a platform to someone who spread hate, when there were so many other choices there. It was greatly resented by many in the LGBT community. In fact, it set off a chain of events (Rev. Robinson "accidentally" not being shown on live TV etc.) which got Obama off on very bad footing with many in the LGBT community.\nFollowing McClurkin, I was very angry with Obama. Then came Warren. But apparently Obama/the inaugural team haven\'t learned anything:\nFrom above Alternet piece:\n(17:37) Men, women, I can’t say anything other to you tonight than this, that if you look at the counsel of the word of God, Old Testament, New Testament, you come quickly to the conclusion that homosexuality is not an alternate lifestyle… homosexuality is not just a sexual preference homosexuality is not gay, but homosexuality is sin. It is sin in the eyes of God, and it is sin according to the word of God. You come to only one conclusion: homosexuality is less than God’s best for his creation. It is less than God’s best for us and everything in our lives that is less than God’s best for us and his plan for us and his design for us, is sin. That’s God’s voice. If you want to hear God’s voice, that is his voice to this issue of homosexuality. It is not ambiguous and unclear. It is very clear.\nThere are numerous other very incendiary quotes.\nSo let me address the naysayers now:\n- But Obama has done so much for LGBT rights, it\'s just a speaker at the Inauguration\nUm, first, if you are trying to make improving LGBT rights a cornerstone of your presidency, you don\'t have to spit in the eye of the people you are supposedly trying to help. This is a PERSONAL choice. Hagel I can somewhat justify because there are other plusses to his candidacy. This is Obama picking yet another bigot when there could be much better choices out there who were/are not so vehemently anti-gay\nAlso, when will he get past this bullshit of making in-roads with these people? These people will always vote against him and his agenda. Why give the marquee moment to a hater\n- But, but he said those things long ago\nYeah, and those are the seeds of hatred which were sown in the very people today who support discrimination against LGBT people.\nAlso, if Shirley Sherrod is up for scrutiny for what she didn\'t even say, Hagel for his homophobic remarks, they why should this guy not be held accountable, as would anything with a history of anti-African American, anti-woman, anti-Hispanic, anti- remarks. Yeah, the times are changing and its time for the haters and the Vichy apologists to be held accountable for hating when it was a much bigger trend.\nAnd for what it\'s worth, I am against Hagel ALSO for this reason. As Maddow pointed out, there will be many, many issues involving LGBT people in the military coming up. So he should answer for his bigotry then. Yet another reason why he is a bad choice.\n- But, but, Obama has a GAY CUBAN poet speaking\nAnd this argument pisses me off most of all. In Obama and Co\'s mind, if you put up a minority group, that cancels out, makes ok having the hater up there. No, it doesn\'t. You don\'t have a "mixed program" by putting up people who have advanced society, like Ms. Evers and those who have held it back. Once again, we\'ll likely have an inauguration with the usual symbolic winks and nods to the LGBT community while the hater gets a front row seat.\nStarting off Obama II in a sucky way, like he started off Obama I. Except he can\'t blame Boehner for this one. A fucking huge disappointment.

That would be theocracy, just like the Taliban, and we will fight it with our last breath.\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport  \n \nOld Vet-462462 \n #434.9 \n\n\n\nScott--Hate to pull rank on you, but I hold three degrees in history (AB, MA, PhD), have published two books and a number of refereed articles, and taught on the university level for 35 years.

Psalm 14:1.\nThe wise man says: Show me the proof!\nFYI, God wins in the end.\nYou\'re free to believe whatever you want.\nThat is Biblical Truth.\nBiblical "truth" does not equal actual fact! Big difference between the two.\nBeing gay IS a choice\nWhen did you choose to be straight?\nGod does exist, by faith.\nSo does Santa Clause, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy. Your point?\nIt was an understood fact that Creator (capitalized "C") was in direct reference to the Christian God of the Bible, Jesus Christ.\nYou merely assume that. you would think that if the Founding Fathers meant the christian god, they would have mentioned "God?"\n\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport', 'type': 'post'}, {'date': 'Sun, 24 Mar 2013 00:09:38 GMT', 'humanLanguage': 'en', 'author': 'ONEREALMAN', 'authorUrl': 'http://onerealman.newsvine.com/', 'diffbotUri': 'post|3|-1333630296', 'html': '<h2><a data-domain-name="redryderralphie" href="http://redryderralphie.newsvine.com/">Red Ryder Ralphie</a></h2>\n<ul><li><a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/23/17418817-same-sex-marriages-big-day-in-court-whats-at-stake#th3690316-c75027328">#435.1</a></li></ul>\n<p>its weird - they cant reproduce but there are more and more of them every day - crawling out from every rock .</p>\n<ul><li><a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/23/17418817-same-sex-marriages-big-day-in-court-whats-at-stake">Reply</a></li><li data-placement="top"><a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/23/17418817-same-sex-marriages-big-day-in-court-whats-at-stake">Share</a></li></ul>\n<h2><a data-domain-name="onerealman" href="http://onerealman.newsvine.com/">ONEREALMAN</a></h2>\n<ul><li><a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/23/17418817-same-sex-marriages-big-day-in-court-whats-at-stake#th3690316-c75027391">#435.2</a></li></ul>\n<p>not % wise just on network tv when progressives are trying for votes . it\'s all about money and power nothing else if you believe anything else then you are being led by the nose</p>\n<ul><li><a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/23/17418817-same-sex-marriages-big-day-in-court-whats-at-stake">Reply</a></li><li data-placement="top"><a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/23/17418817-same-sex-marriages-big-day-in-court-whats-at-stake">Share</a></li></ul>\n<h2><a data-domain-name="scottlee46" href="http://scottlee46.newsvine.com/">ScottLee46</a></h2>\n<ul><li><a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/23/17418817-same-sex-marriages-big-day-in-court-whats-at-stake#th3690316-c75027725">#435.3</a></li></ul>\n<p>Red Ryder,</p>\n<p>There are more and more of them (gays) bec. perversion is now fashionable.

Male lions wandering looking for a pride to take over will copulate with each other until they dethrone a male in charge of a pride. Amongst our primate relatives, homosexual activity is the norm. As in, most of our monkey, gorilla, and chimpanzee close relatives engage in homosexual fun on a regular basis. In fact, bonobo chimps are all bisexual. As in, every last one—male or female—will engage in recreational sex with just about any member—male or female—of his/her troop. Aside from the fact they find it a lot of fun (because they do it a lot!), we know it helps them build social cohesion.\nThe same way it is used by humans for both fun, and to establish personal bonds.\nSo, stop being ignorant. Or, at least, stop spewing your tired and incorrect ignorant rhetoric. We are out of the Dark Ages you brought us, and will not be listening to you any longer.', 'type': 'post'}, {'date': 'Sun, 24 Mar 2013 01:05:28 GMT', 'humanLanguage': 'en', 'author': 'JohnWW1', 'authorUrl': 'http://johnww1.newsvine.com/', 'diffbotUri': 'post|3|-1692241960', 'html': '<h2><a data-domain-name="richardcoon856" href="http://richardcoon856.newsvine.com/">Richard C-458756</a></h2>\n<ul><li><a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/23/17418817-same-sex-marriages-big-day-in-court-whats-at-stake#th3690316-c75028054">#447.1</a></li></ul>\n<p>But it\'s such a great distraction from the real issues!!</p>\n<ul><li><a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/23/17418817-same-sex-marriages-big-day-in-court-whats-at-stake">Reply</a></li><li data-placement="top"><a href="http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/03/23/17418817-same-sex-marriages-big-day-in-court-whats-at-stake">Share</a></li></ul>\n<h2><a data-domain-name="mjones3318143" href="http://mjones3318143.newsvine.com/">M.

If you want to keep believing as fervently as you do, I suggest you don\'t study the history of the Bible. Some people do that and wonder why there are different texts for Protestants and Catholics; some wonder about the fact that the Biblical canon took centuries to solidfy and was ultimately adopted by humans who often fought vigorously over what should and should not be in the Bible; others suggest that ancient stories passed down as oral tradition for centuries before being written in ancient Hebrew, translated into Amarhic, translated into Greek, translated from Greek into Latin, and thence into English by people who may not have been that skilled in the languages they were working in should not be taken literally, particularly when there seem to be so many versions around. Myself, I\'m looking for the Gospel of Thomas, but I have doubts about it.</p>\n<p>Karl--You\'re absolutely right.

If you want to keep believing as fervently as you do, I suggest you don\'t study the history of the Bible. Some people do that and wonder why there are different texts for Protestants and Catholics; some wonder about the fact that the Biblical canon took centuries to solidfy and was ultimately adopted by humans who often fought vigorously over what should and should not be in the Bible; others suggest that ancient stories passed down as oral tradition for centuries before being written in ancient Hebrew, translated into Amarhic, translated into Greek, translated from Greek into Latin, and thence into English by people who may not have been that skilled in the languages they were working in should not be taken literally, particularly when there seem to be so many versions around. Myself, I\'m looking for the Gospel of Thomas, but I have doubts about it.\n\nKarl--You\'re absolutely right.

Can you imagine willingly dying rather than accept a false god, as Jews did when Christians demanded of them during the Inquisition? Do you really think those devout, believing Jews would have died rather than do so if they didn\'t know -- with just as much certainty as you-- they THEY knew God?\nMy point isn\'t to denigrate your beliefs. I know they are sincere.\nI also know that we each reach our Truth in much the same way: through introspection, prayer, experience (even spiritual experiences), reading, discussing, and eventually, believing.\nThat you found your Truth is wonderful. I wish you well.\nI believe --in my heart-- that God is greater than any collection of writings, however great the mortals were and however inspired they felt they were or you feel they were.\nWe are ALL in this journey together.

Because it is one of the several hundred orders given in the Bible that Christians don\'t follow. Oh sure, you get the occasional Mother Theresa who does follow it, but the overwhelming majority simply ignore the passages they don\'t like. Mind you, they still expect the rest of us to follow the passages they do like, and will preach to us the ones they don\'t like, but they sure won\'t even try to follow any of the passages that puts a crimp in their own style.</p>\n<p>So, go sell all you got--every last jot and tittle, and give it all away. Then, and only then, do you have the right to be preachy. Oh, and lest you think you are doing at least some good by preaching to us despite your hypocrisy, I remind you of an ORDER Jesus gave to his followers:</p>\n<p>&quot;You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother\'s eye.&quot; Matthew 7:5</p>\n<p>Let us know when you have sold everything and given it all away.

The bible says not to lay up treasure on earth where rust and moss collect, but to lay up treasures in heaven. We should be willing to help where help is honestly needed.</p>\n<p>Yes we are to examine ourselves first before pointing out sin in another person\'s life, take the plank out of my own eye before I try and remove the speck from someone else\'s. I have to always remind myself of the sins in my past so I don\'t make the same mistakes over. Someone on here earlier mocked me because I said I had sin in my life, I imagine it might just happen again. But I guess it goes with the territory when you bring up bible scripture. God sent Jesus for everyone, I certainly have never thought I was better than anyone else here! Sorry if that is the way it is recieved, but I do take God\'s word very seriously. I won\'t say exactly which one, but I\'ve struggled with my own past sexual sins. I have to pray often and read His word everyday to keep myself strong and in His will.</p>\n<p>Maybe this will all be a big laugh for you, I don\'t know? But that\'s alright, I don\'t really expect to be respected for what I believe. I am at peace knowing that I strive everyday to do God\'s will and not my own. Jesus loves you!!</p>\n<p>p.s.

Your refusal to obey the words you preach are noted for all to see. Forever and ever. This is your testimony. This is how a &quot;follower of Jesus&quot; is <strong>most accurately seen</strong>.

Luke tells us that he <br>\nhad power to rule (Luke 18:18). The man asked Jesus &lsquo;What must I do so that I <br>\ncan get eternal life?&rsquo; Eternal life is life that never ends. It begins on earth <br>\nand it continues in heaven with God. We cannot do something special to get it <br>\nand we cannot pay money for it. It is a valuable gift from God. The man said <br>\nthat Jesus was good. Jesus told him that only God is good. But Jesus did not say <br>\nthat he was bad.</p>\n<p>God&rsquo;s rules are called &lsquo;the commandments&rsquo; <br>\n(Exodus 20:3-17).

Mind you, they still expect the rest of us to follow the passages they do like, and will preach to us the ones they don\'t like, but they sure won\'t even try to follow any of the passages that puts a crimp in their own style.\nSo, go sell all you got--every last jot and tittle, and give it all away. Then, and only then, do you have the right to be preachy. Oh, and lest you think you are doing at least some good by preaching to us despite your hypocrisy, I remind you of an ORDER Jesus gave to his followers:\n"You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother\'s eye." Matthew 7:5\n\nLet us know when you have sold everything and given it all away. We\'ll be waiting...\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport  \n \nHow Great Thou Art \n #463.3 \n\n\nasygifvasi,\nI agree that we are to help the needy, but that doesn\'t mean you sell everything and become equally as poor. The bible says not to lay up treasure on earth where rust and moss collect, but to lay up treasures in heaven. We should be willing to help where help is honestly needed.\nYes we are to examine ourselves first before pointing out sin in another person\'s life, take the plank out of my own eye before I try and remove the speck from someone else\'s. I have to always remind myself of the sins in my past so I don\'t make the same mistakes over. Someone on here earlier mocked me because I said I had sin in my life, I imagine it might just happen again. But I guess it goes with the territory when you bring up bible scripture. God sent Jesus for everyone, I certainly have never thought I was better than anyone else here! Sorry if that is the way it is recieved, but I do take God\'s word very seriously. I won\'t say exactly which one, but I\'ve struggled with my own past sexual sins. I have to pray often and read His word everyday to keep myself strong and in His will.\nMaybe this will all be a big laugh for you, I don\'t know? But that\'s alright, I don\'t really expect to be respected for what I believe. I am at peace knowing that I strive everyday to do God\'s will and not my own. Jesus loves you!!\np.s. Thank you for pointing out scriptures, I always go and check them out if it\'s not one I\'m familiar with!\n\nSincerely, Me\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport  \n \nasygifvasi \n #463.4 \n\n\nHow Great Thou Art -- NO! You do NOT get to "agree"!!! The ORDER given by Jesus to YOU is to "Sell what ye possess". Period. No exceptions! Notice you were not told "sell a few things you don\'t want anymore at a garage sell and then take and give a percentage of that to the Slavation Army kettle when convenient."\nNo, you were told to sell it all. No exceptions listed. None. Notice Jesus did not give you the option of "except for the possessions you want to keep". You are as bad as Saul--keeping only a portion of what you are told to do--basically what you want to do--and rationalizing away the rest. Notice God\'s view of how he feels about people who only do the convenient and easy part of their marching orders.\nSo here we are, Thou Hypocrite. Your refusal to obey the words you preach are noted for all to see. Forever and ever. This is your testimony. This is how a "follower of Jesus" is most accurately seen. Not even trusting the Bible enough to follow the direct orders not subject to interpretation. You come in here and preach and preach and preach, but lack the conviction to read and obey.\nYa, I know, according to your faith, you will still go into Heaven despite the fact that even second of every day of your entire life you reject this and hundreds of other orders given to you by "God" and "Jesus" and willfully turn away from him each and every one of those seconds.\nTo the rest of us, however, we judge you by your hypocrisy, and perceive accurately that you do what you want when you want and feel pretty decent about it. Which is, of course, what we do. Like you, we reject the portions of the Bible we don\'t feel are relevant--namely all of it. And we go through life not enjoying it when people tell us that we must modify our behavior because someone else believes differently.\nWhich is, of course, the same way you don\'t enjoy me reminding you that you still, according to the Bible starting this very second, need to divest your self of your possessions and give it all away...\n\nAnd until that point, we should just call you Saul.\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport  \n \nHolly-2271628 \n #463.5 \n\n\n\nAsy is right.

Which this rich man was not willing to do in order to have eternal life. Jesus isn\'t calling us sinners because we have posessions, we are to love Jesus above all else. Do you believe He died for your sins?\n5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;\n6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;\n7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.\nMark tells us that the man was very rich.\nMatthew tells us that the man was young (Matthew 19:20). Luke tells us that he\nhad power to rule (Luke 18:18). The man asked Jesus ‘What must I do so that I\ncan get eternal life?’ Eternal life is life that never ends. It begins on earth\nand it continues in heaven with God. We cannot do something special to get it\nand we cannot pay money for it. It is a valuable gift from God. The man said\nthat Jesus was good. Jesus told him that only God is good. But Jesus did not say\nthat he was bad.\nGod’s rules are called ‘the commandments’\n(Exodus 20:3-17). Some of them are about the way that we live with other people.\nSome of them are about how we should show love to God. The man said that he had\nalways obeyed those rules. He thought that he was a really good person. Jesus\nloved the man. Jesus told him what else he needed to do. The man had lots of\nmoney. It was very important to him. But the first of God’s rules says that God\nmust be most important in our lives. The man needed to decide what to do. When\nGod gives people the gift of eternal life they are very happy. They will be\nhappy always. But the man loved money more than he loved God. He could not\nreceive the gift.\n\nThe End\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport  \n \nskrekk \n #463.8 \n\n\nHow Great Thou Art - God’s rules are called ‘the commandments’\nToo bad our 1st Amendment directly contradicts your imaginary friend\'s 1st Commandment, eh?\n\nThat must really frustrate you.\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport  \n \n\nasygifvasi \n #463.9 \n\n\nNo, he does not want you to be "willing to do it".

Don't bully or condeme them for what they do because the man upstairs will be the judge of that. I believe marriage needs to stay between a MAN and WOMAN period and uphold DOMA and Prop. 8. They about have the same amount of rights and respect as other people do anyways but no SSM or SSA for them it's just two people of the same sex cannot repropuce or make a kid and have a family. I'm dissapointed in the president, his administration for advocating to SSM they must really be proud of theirselves and the 133 republicans that were once against this, gave in to the democrats and signed that breif to OK SSM y'all are nothing but a bunch of gutless, spineless, flip flopping lowlife weasels instead of putting on y'alls big boy pants and standing up for whats right. That's all half the politicians out there care about is gay rights and SSM instead of focusing on the real problem which is the deficit, the ecconomy, jobs, and national security or did everybody forget about all of that. You liberals and people who are going along with legalizing same sex marriage must think the war or marriage will be over if we legalize same sex marriage across the board right? Wrong! Tell you right now that they are other groups wanting their rights as well. When the battle for same sex marriage is over and done with whats next? Since you liberals are all gunghoed about treating every american from every walk of life the same and pushing for marriage equality then I'll go by what the liberals say exact words, why don't we just give polygamist, incestors, and pedophiles their rights too while we're at it? Hey y'all said from every walk of life RIGHT or WRONG! Or even denying the prostitutes their right to make a living. The polygamist, incestors, and pedophiles are looked at by society now like the gays were 40 years ago so I don't see much difference in their situation. So the liberals and anybody going along with SSM says anybody who opposes marriage to gays is a bigot right? Well if the liberals and democrats deny rights to the polygamists, incestors, and pedophiles then that would make them bigots as well. Yes most high school kids can consent to sex below the age of consent. Not all pedophiles hurt or kill kids some are just attracted to 15 to 17 year old kids who look old enough for sex so no argument there. Since we're in no position to tell gays they can't marry the same sex who are we to tell that 50 year old man he can't marry that 15 year old girl or that guy he can't marry his own sister, or that guy of how many wives he can have. Since we're supposed to be an all love non discriminating tolerant society, so whats to stop the polygamist, incestors, and pedophiles from getting on that platform fighting and protesting for their rights? Where does it end? If the gays can do it why not the rest of them as well. Make the so called marriage equality EQUAL for everybody don't stop with the gays. My point is if you legalize one sexual deviance legalize all of them or legalize none of them because I think they're all equally wrong and discusting. Marriage is meant for a man and woman only, gays should only have unions and thats how far I'd let it go. We need morals and principal back in this country.

Don't bully or condeme them for what they do because the man upstairs will be the judge of that. I believe marriage needs to stay between a MAN and WOMAN period and uphold DOMA and Prop. 8. They about have the same amount of rights and respect as other people do anyways but no SSM or SSA for them it's just two people of the same sex cannot repropuce or make a kid and have a family. I'm dissapointed in the president, his administration for advocating to SSM they must really be proud of theirselves and the 133 republicans that were once against this, gave in to the democrats and signed that breif to OK SSM y'all are nothing but a bunch of gutless, spineless, flip flopping lowlife weasels instead of putting on y'alls big boy pants and standing up for whats right. That's all half the politicians out there care about is gay rights and SSM instead of focusing on the real problem which is the deficit, the ecconomy, jobs, and national security or did everybody forget about all of that. You liberals and people who are going along with legalizing same sex marriage must think the war or marriage will be over if we legalize same sex marriage across the board right? Wrong! Tell you right now that they are other groups wanting their rights as well. When the battle for same sex marriage is over and done with whats next? Since you liberals are all gunghoed about treating every american from every walk of life the same and pushing for marriage equality then I'll go by what the liberals say exact words, why don't we just give polygamist, incestors, and pedophiles their rights too while we're at it?

I pretty much speak my mind. Yes the bible states to love thy neighbor as thy self and that includes gays, but don't agree with the life style, not to hate, condeme, or bully the gays for what they do because what the gays do in their bedroom is their business and we have to respect that, I just don't agree with same sex marriage or same sex adoption at all. Same sex couples cannot make or reproduce a kid so they can't make a family. A true family needs to consist of a mom and dad (MAN and WOMAN) to raise kids. Marriage needs to be defined between a MAN and WOMAN period. I don't see nothing wrong with the gays just having unions but marriage is going too far. Other than that the gays have just as much rights and just as much respected as other people. All that atleast half of the polititians out there care about is gay rights or SSM instead of focusing on the real issues like the ecconomy, the deficit, jobs and the national security but I reckon people forgot about all of that. I'm disapointed with the president and his administration for backing SSM not that I wanted none of them in office to begin with. As for the 133 republicans that were once against SSM but now signed that brief to OK SSM and gave in to the democrats y'all aint nothing but a bunch of gutless, spineless, flip flopping, lowlife dirtbags. Instead of the republicans putting on their big boy pants and standing up for what's right I reckon they're gonna be @!$%# kissing the gays too just like the democrats. If the republican party goes liberal there wouldn't be much difference in democrats and republicans. Well, since the liberals and democrats say we have to accept people from all walks of life and no discrimination allowed, plus saying that it's unconstitutional and bigoted to go against same sex marriage. The liberals and people advocating SSM think that the war on marriage will end when SSM is legalized all across the board right? Wrong because they're other groups wanting their rights also. I think the democrats and everybody else thats all gunghoed about advocating to SSM are just as much bigoted as the people opposing SSM if they deny the polygamists, incestors, and pedophiles rights, why not just give those kind of people their rights too while we're at it, wouldn't that be unconstitutional if we don't since we're supposed to be an all love, tolerant non discriminating society, y'all said y'all are accepting people from all walks of life. What's to stop them from getting on that platform fighting and protesting for their rights like the gays did and still doing, it's just a matter of time. The polygamists, incestors, and pedophiles are looked at now by society like the gays were back 40 years ago so I don't see much difference in their situation. Who cares weather it's nasty or wrong, can't use that arguement because it was already used against the gays and people condemed it. Not all pedophiles harm or kill kids some are just attracted to 15 or 17 year old kids that look almost fully developed, and yes most high scoolers younger than the legal age limit of consent can too consent to sex. Why not just let the prostitutes have their right to make their living? This so called marriage equality why does it have to stop with the gays why not make marriage equality EQUAL for everybody meaning the polygamists, incestors, and pedophiles. In other words since we're in no position to tell the gays what sex person to marry who are we to tell that 50 year old guy he can't marry that 15 year old girl, or tell that guy how many wives he can have, or tell this other guy he can't marry his own flesh and blood sister. What I'm saying is either legalize all sexual devient practices or legalize none of them. Otherwise marriage needs to just stay between a man and woman, and keep upholding DOMA and proposition 8 in the books. We need to bring morals and principal back in to this country that we sadly lost.

USATODAY\nA federal judge has ruled that gay marriages may continue in Utah\nJudge Richard Shelby on Monday denied a request by the state of Utah to halt the weddings pending appeal\nUtah is expected to ask a higher court to put the process on hold\nA federal judge has ruled that gay marriage in Utah may continue, making Utah the 18th state in addition to the District of Columbia where gay and lesbian couples can marry.\nJudge Richard Shelby on Monday denied a request by the state that sought to halt gay marriage until the appeals process plays out.\nCouples on Monday waited to marry in lines that at times stretched for blocks outside the Salt Lake City County Government Center. Some had spent the night in their cars in the parking lot to make sure they didn\'t miss their chance.\nWell-wishers arrived with flowers, coffee and doughnuts to give to the brides and grooms waiting in the chill morning air. At midmorning a group of Christmas carolers arrived to serenade them.\nFor now, a state considered as one of the most conservative in the nation has joined the likes of California and New York to become the 18th where same-sex couples can legally wed.\nUtah is home to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which was one of the leading forces behind California\'s short-lived ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8, which voters approved in 2008. The church said Friday that it stands by its support for "traditional marriage" and that it hopes a higher court validates its belief that marriage is between a man and woman.\nThe state Office of the Attorney General appealed to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver to have Shelby\'s ruling stayed just after it was issued, said spokesman Ryan Bruckman in Salt Lake City.\nThe marriages will continue until the appeal is either upheld or denied, he said.\nThe decision drew a swift and angry reaction from Republican Gov. Gary Herbert, who said he was disappointed in an "activist federal judge attempting to override the will of the people of Utah."\nGay couples began lining up to marry on Friday when Shelby overturned Utah\'s ban on same-sex marriage, ruling it is unconstitutional. Lines continued to be out the door in many areas as couples raced to get married for fear a stay might be issued and the wedding ended.\nJolene Abbott, 39, and her wife, Colleen Mewing, 51, were married in July in Washington State. But they got married in Salt Lake City Monday afternoon just to make extra sure they were well and truly married in their home state.\n"An attorney friend of ours told us that if the appeal goes through they might still recognize the marriages that have occurred in Utah so far, but couples married outside of the state might not be recognized," she said of their decision to marry for a second time.\nUtah\'s Bruckman doesn\'t think that is correct but he\'s not sure. "It\'s the million dollar question. We\'re in a state of flux, where Amendment 3 (which bans same sex marriage in Utah) is the law and is not the law."\n"We don\'t have a timetable on this," Bruckman said.\nRetired Utah state representative Jackie Biskupski was at the Government Center officiating at weddings on Monday. "I\'ve done about ten today. The clerks are issuing about 45 licenses an hour and there are over 50 ministers in the building to marry people."\nShe believes that gay couples who are legally married elsewhere but live in Utah "need to get married in Utah to have that marriage recognized here."\nSome county clerks are refusing to issue licenses to same sex couples. Other have "elected, for safety\'s sake, to not give out any marriage licenses at all until we know what we\'re required to do," said Bruckman.\nGroups advocating for same sex marriage expressed pleasure at Shelby\'s ruling.\n"We\'re thrilled that this decision continues the process of decisions across the country that support the right of gay and lesbian couples to get married and have their love and families protected equally under the law," said Brian Silva, executive director of Marriage Equality. The New York City-based group promotes the rights of gay and lesbian couples to marry.\nThe 53-page ruling said the constitutional amendment Utah voters approved in 2004 violates gay and lesbian couples\' rights to due process and equal protection under the 14th Amendment. Shelby said the state failed to show that allowing same-sex marriages would affect opposite-sex marriages in any way.\nThe ruling has thrust Shelby into the national spotlight. He has been on the bench for less than two years, appointed by President Obama after GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch recommended him in November 2011.\nShelby served in the Utah Army National Guard from 1988 to 1996 and was a combat engineer in Operation Desert Storm. He graduated from the University of Virginia law school in 1998 and clerked for the U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Greene in Utah, then spent about 12 years in private practice before he became a judge.\nContributing: The Associated Press

Robert Galbraith/Reuters\nIN 1997, two prominent conservative writers, David Frum and Andrew Sullivan, debated same-sex marriage for the online magazine Slate.\nFrum defended what was then the consensus conservative (and consensus national) position. Redefining marriage to include same-sex couples, he argued, would explicitly sever the institution’s connection to the two interrelated realities, gender difference and procreation, that it had evolved to address. In so doing, it would replace a traditional view of matrimony with a broader, thinner, more adult-centric view, which would ultimately be less likely to bind parents to children, husbands to wives.\n“Proponents of gay marriage can only get what they want,” Frum wrote, “by weakening Americans’ attachment to the traditional family even more than it has already been weakened,” and speeding the “process of social dissolution” that the 1960s and 1970s began.\nSullivan countered that the “process” Frum feared was simply an established fact. Heterosexuals had already severed marriage from procreation and permanence, and so there was no more reason to deny same-sex couples marriage licenses than to deny them to the infertile and elderly. Indeed, far from being radical, gay marriage was more likely to be stabilizing, “sending a message about matrimonial responsibility and mutual caring” to gays and straights alike.\nHalf a generation later, Sullivan’s view has carried the day almost completely. The conservative argument still has serious exponents, but it’s now chuckled at in courtrooms, dismissed by intellectuals, mocked in the media and (in a sudden, recent rush) abandoned by politicians. Indeed, it has been abandoned by Frum himself, who is now energetically urging Republicans to embrace the redefinition of marriage he once warned against.\nYet for an argument that has persuaded so few, the conservative view has actually had decent predictive power. As the cause of gay marriage has pressed forward, the social link between marriage and childbearing has indeed weakened faster than before. As the public’s shift on the issue has accelerated, so has marriage’s overall decline.\nSince Frum warned that gay marriage could advance only at traditional wedlock’s expense, the marriage rate has been falling faster, the out-of-wedlock birthrate has been rising faster, and the substitution of cohabitation for marriage has markedly increased. Underlying these trends is a steady shift in values: Americans are less likely to see children as important to marriage and less likely to see marriage as important to childbearing (the generation gap on gay marriage shows up on unwed parenting as well) than even in the very recent past.\nCorrelations do not, of course, establish causation. The economy is obviously playing a leading role in the retreat from marriage — the shocks of recession, the stagnation of wages, the bleak prospects of blue-collar men. Culturally, what matters most is the emergence of what the National Marriage Project calls a “capstone” understanding of marriage, which treats wedlock less as a foundation for adulthood and more as a celebration of adult achievement — and which seems to work out far better for our disciplined upper class than for society as a whole.\nBut there is also a certain willed naïveté to the idea that the advance of gay marriage is unrelated to any other marital trend. For 10 years, America’s only major public debate about marriage and family has featured one side — judges and journalists, celebrities and now finally politicians — pressing the case that modern marriage has nothing to do with the way human beings reproduce themselves, that the procreative understanding of the institution was founded entirely on prejudice, and that the shift away from a male-female marital ideal is analogous to the end of segregation.\nNow that this argument seems on its way to victory, is it really plausible that it has changed how Americans view gay relationships while leaving all other ideas about matrimony untouched?\nYou can tell this naïveté is willed because it’s selective. There are plenty of interesting arguments, often from gay writers, about how the march to gay marriage might be influencing heterosexual norms — from Alex Ross’s recent musings in The New Yorker on the sudden “queer vibe” in straight pop culture to Dan Savage’s famous argument that straights might do well to imitate the “monogamish” norms of some gay male couples. It’s only the claim that this influence might not always be positive that is dismissed as bigotry and unreason.\nA more honest, less triumphalist case for gay marriage would be willing to concede that, yes, there might be some social costs to redefining marriage. It would simply argue that those costs are too diffuse and hard to quantify to outweigh the immediate benefits of recognizing gay couples’ love and commitment.\nSuch honesty would make social liberals more magnanimous in what looks increasingly like victory, and less likely to hound and harass religious institutions that still want to elevate and defend the older marital ideal.\nBut whether people think they’re on the side of God or of History, magnanimity has rarely been a feature of the culture war.

FL-1064284 Comment collapsed by the community\nHere are some ways that the radical gay extremist liberal Democrat agenda would bring destruction to our nation:\n1. It would sanction fatherless and motherless households and condemn children to a single sex family with no female or male role model. This is proven to be destructive in a majority of studies. Actually this has not been proven.\n2. It would open the definition of marriage to all variances such a polygamy, incest marriages between same sex brothers or sisters. child / adult marriages, timed marriages and even bestiality. I am sure there would be other variants besides these. "Marriage" would become a free-for-all mess. Polygamy, incest and brother/sister marriages would all be "straight" marriages. You deal with that. We are talking about same sex marriages. Also in the countries that have allowed same sex marriage which ones have started what you list here?\n3. It will damage children - most gays are very unstable people. The gay divorce rate in recent studies is over 100 times the divorce rate of heterosexual divorces. This is the very definition of instability\nPlease list these so called studies. How can you have 100 times the divorce rate of 50% for straight couples. Please list this study as well.\n4. The radical gay extremist liberal Democrat world view of "morality" would be legally FORCED on everyone who does not agree with their morality. You would be forced to teach your children what they tell you to teach them - I repeat you would be FORCED to teach your children what gay dictators told you to teach them.\nYou have the choice of home schooling should you decide to raise your children under a rock. At some point your children will find out that some people are different. Are you going to wait until they are 18 to teach them about diversity?\n5. Christian pastors would be arrested for preaching the Bible - this is happening in Canada. So there would be no freedom of religion and no freedom of conscious for Christians (and Muslims for that matter). The radical gay liberal extremists would be able to dictate what pastors taught in their churches - you know like Hitler did after he put 4 million Christians in concentration camps.\nBelieve it or not we really do not care what you preach until it spills over into our lives. Preach what you want and believe what you want. We will do the same.\nYou are basing this statement on what?\n7. The laws we have in place for marriage benefits and worker benefits would undergo radical changes costing tax payers billions of dollars and increasing the national debt. Virtually any two people will be able to claim marriage benefits simply by claiming they are gay or bi-sexual which will produce catastrophic fraud with both business and government benefits. For example, two heterosexual male roommates could get “married” in order to claim partner benefits from the company that one of them worked at while maintaining relationships with girlfriends and just claim they are “bisexual.”\nAnother un-informed statement. You must present documentation to a company that you are living together when applying for same sex benefits. Fraud could occur but the same fraud could occur between a man and woman claiming to be "married" when they are dating other members of the same sex.\n8. Christian businesses and individuals will be sued if they stay true to God and their morals and do not support gay marriage. Eventually, courts may even put Christians in jail for not compromising their morals and their faith in God.\nMost state laws require you to serve everyone without exception. If this is a problem then do not open a business... Open a club.\n9. The homosexual extremists will you lawsuits and liberal judges to avoid a democrat vote of American people. Where they lose under a constitutional vote they will try to use judges who have no respect for the Constitution. This has already occurred in several states.\nNot sure what this means but I think you are saying a judge will overrule the vote of a majority? That is correct because you cannot vote on the rights of others. Sorry but that is la

Celebrity chef Paula Deen hopes the Supreme Court\'s ruling allowing same-sex marriage to be legal in California will help in her defense against a racial discrimination lawsuit.\nThe woman alleging that she was subjected to a hostile work environment while working as an assistant manager at Deen\'s restaurants is white and therefore doesn\'t have the "standing," or legal right, to claim racial discrimination, according to a motion filed Monday by Deen\'s lawyer.\nThe high court rejected an appeal of California\'s Proposition 8 law last week on the grounds that the private parties behind the appeal did not have standing to defend the ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock.\nEven if the federal judge in Savannah, Georgia, accepts the argument and tosses the lawsuit, much damage has already been done to Deen\'s career and businesses by the public fallout from a deposition in which she acknowledged using the "N-word."\nAsked by the lawyer taking the deposition if she had ever used the word, she said, "Yes, of course."\nShe said she had probably used the racial slur when talking to her husband about "when a black man burst into the bank that I was working at and put a gun to my head" -- an incident that took place 30 years ago.\nAsked if she had used it since then, she said, "I\'m sure I have, but it\'s been a very long time." She noted that circumstances have changed "since the \'60s in the South."\nMany of Deen\'s lucrative business relationships have crumbled in the wake of media coverage of the lawsuit. She has lost at least nine endorsements along with her Food Network cooking show, and publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook has been canceled.\nDeen attorney William Franklin\'s motion, filed Monday with the U.S. District Court in Savannah, cited the June 26 Supreme Court decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry, the California case.\n"Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts made this observation: Article III of the Constitution confines the judicial power of federal courts to deciding actual \'Cases\' or \'Controversies,\'" the motion said. "One essential aspect of this requirement is that any person invoking the power of a federal court must demonstrate standing to do so. This requires the litigant to prove that he has suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct, and is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision."\nGeorge Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told CNN Tuesday the contention that the Prop 8 ruling is relevant to the Deen case won\'t hold water.\nThe concept of standing is hardly new, and the Supreme Court bringing it into the spotlight in Hollingsworth v. Perry doesn\'t not advance Deen\'s motion to dismiss the case, Turley said.\nLisa Jackson, the plaintiff in the suit against Deen is white, has no standing because she couldn\'t have suffered "a personal and tangible harm" from hearing the "N-word" on the job, the Franklin\'s , motion says.\nIn the Prop 8 case, state officials refused to pursue an appeal when a federal judge struck down the same-sex marriage ban. Private citizens picked it up, ultimately to be told by the high court last week that they had no standing to do so.\nJackson is a former manager at Deen\'s restaurants in Savannah, Georgia. She is suing Deen and her brother, Bubba Hier, alleging they committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five-year employment at Deen\'s Lady & Sons and Bubba\'s Seafood and Oyster House eateries in Savannah.\n"This lawsuit has never been about the N-word," she said. "It is to address Ms. Deen\'s patterns of disrespect and degradation of people that she deems to be inferior. I may be a white woman, but I could no longer tolerate her abuse of power as a business owner, nor her condonation of Mr. Hier\'s despicable behavior on a day-to-day basis. I am what I am, and I am a human being that cares about all races, and that is why I feel it is important to be the voice for those who are too afraid to use theirs."\nDeen\'s lawyer has called the allegations false, and Deen has said she does not tolerate prejudice.\nDeen made an emotional appearance on NBC\'s "Today Show" last week in which she called the accusations "horrible, horrible lies."\n"I believe that every creature on this Earth, every one of God\'s creatures, was created equal," she said. "... I believe that everyone ought to be treated equal."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Whatever the U.S. Supreme Court decides this month, gay marriage appears destined to face several more years of legal debate and at least one more round of argument at the high court.\nThat’s because a majority of the court’s nine justices, based on their record and comments during March’s oral arguments, are unlikely to proclaim a national right to same-sex marriage in the pending cases, and momentum for it in the states may soon slow as the battleground moves beyond the Northeast. Any right to gay marriage will come only if the Supreme Court declares it, probably years from now if it should happen.\nGay rights advocates are already girding for the next round of a struggle that stirs cultural, religious and political passions in the United States as elsewhere.\nAmong the nearly two dozen cases left to decide in the final weeks of the court’s term, the two gay rights disputes are among the most closely watched. One is over a provision of the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act that denies U.S. benefits such as Social Security survivor checks for married same-sex couples. In their March hearing the justices appeared poised to invalidate the provision.\nThe other dispute, with potentially greater impact, tests California’s 2008 ban on same-sex marriage. Challengers urged the court to break the ban and rule that gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to marry. But during arguments in March the justices appeared likely to rule in a way that would affect only Californians. Lower federal courts struck down Proposition 8, and it is improbable that a majority on the high court would reverse that trend and endorse the ban.\nBy and large, the justices typically keep an eye on the states as they take up major social-policy dilemmas. They may not want to get too far out in front of social changes, aware of the backlash generated 40 years ago when the court established a constitutional right to abortion. The 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, issued just as states were considering related legislation, remains one of the court’s most controversial modern rulings.\nNEEDED: A NATIONAL WIN\nTwelve of the 50 states and the District of Columbia permit gay men and lesbians to marry. Three of the dozen - Delaware, Minnesota and Rhode Island - legalized such unions this year, and the laws take effect this summer, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nClose observers of state legislatures say that action in Democrat-dominated states may soon run its course and that about half the states are likely to remain entrenched against gay marriage because of their conservative cast.\nInterviewed this week, Theodore Olson, who argued in the Supreme Court against the California ban on gay marriage, said advocates believe they eventually will need a ruling rooted in the U.S. Constitution to make gay marriage legal nationwide.\n“We have to win at some point on a national level because not all the states are going to legalize it,” Olson said. He would not discount the possibility that the justices would rule broadly this month for gay men and lesbians but said advocates were thinking of the next phase anyway.\nOlson and other lawyers seeking a constitutional marriage right say a model state for the next court challenge would be one that meets two main criteria. It would be a place where voters were unlikely to approve gay marriage in the near future, because approval would render any lawsuit moot. Ideally the state also would be in a region where judges are inclined to strike down a ban on same-sex unions, as happened in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit covering California.\nOne such state might be Virginia, which defined marriage as only between a man and woman in a 2006 state constitutional amendment. It also is one of the five states in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. Because of Democratic President Barack Obama’s appointments in recent years, that bench has a strong majority of Democratic appointees and may vote more liberally.\nCharles Cooper, who argued for the California ban at the Supreme Court in the case of Hollingsworth v. Perry, declined to comment on his side’s next steps pending a ruling.\nA CIVIL RIGHTS SAGA\nWhile more developments lie ahead, the legal fight over gay marriage already constitutes one of the most concentrated civil rights sagas in U.S. history. Just 20 years ago the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that its state constitution could allow gay marriage, prompting a nationwide backlash and spurring Congress and a majority of states, including Hawaii, to pass laws defining marriage as between only a man and woman.\nIn 2003, when the top court of Massachusetts established a right to same-sex marriage under its constitution, the action triggered another backlash as states then adopted constitutional amendments against such unions. Five years later, the tide began to reverse, and states slowly began joining Massachusetts in permitting lesbians and gay men to marry. Most of those states are in the Northeast.\nOpinion polls show a steady increase in public support for gay marriage, and this month the Pew Research Center found that 51 percent of Americans now favor allowing it. That poll also found that three-quarters of people responding believed legal recognition of same-sex marriage nationwide would happen one day.\nThat day might not be so soon.\n“There may be a slim national majority for same-sex marriage, but there isn’t a majority in a large number of states,” said Jack Tweedie, director of the children and families program at the National Conference of State Legislatures. Tweedie noted that a majority of states have reinforced their opposition to gay marriage with constitutional amendments in the past decade. About 30 states now have such bans on the books.\nGay rights advocates say if the court strikes down the law denying federal benefits in the case of United States v. Windsor, state action on same-sex marriage might accelerate, especially in states that already allow civil unions for gays and lesbians. Still, lawyer David Codell, who specializes in gay legal rights and is a director at UCLA’s Williams Institute, predicted some states would never go that route on their own.\n“It seems likely that at some point a constitutional ruling from the court will be necessary for full equality nationwide,” he said. “The issue remains tougher than people think.”

Last week the US Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. But same-sex marriage has been possible in some states since 2004 - and one gay couple even craftily obtained a marriage licence more than 40 years ago.\n"We\'re gonna win eventually, not this time but maybe the next time around."\nIn 1973, gay rights activist Jack Baker told an American talk show it was just a matter of time before same-sex marriage would be legalised.\nHe was appearing on the influential David Susskind Show, broadcast nationwide, after he and his partner, Michael McConnell, had managed to secure a marriage licence by subterfuge.\nFor Baker, marriage was a civil rights issue.\n"It goes to the core of discrimination, you cannot let non-gay people treat you differently… you have to say \'I pay taxes to support this government and it is going to recognise me as an equal citizen or by God I\'m going to disrupt that government.\'"\nThe prevailing image of homosexuality in the early 1970s was a caricature - flamboyant men in gay bars, and a lifestyle of wild promiscuity.\nGoing public about your sexual orientation could cost you your home, your job and your family.\nBaker and McConnell didn\'t fit the stereotype. Both in their late 20s - clean cut and with short, neat hair - Baker was a law student and McConnell a librarian. They\'d been together for four years when they first applied for a marriage licence in 1970.\nThis was rejected - on the grounds that they were both men. But the couple decided to fight. They appealed, and kept on appealing until the case reached the US Supreme Court. It was the first time the court had been asked to rule on gay marriage - but it refused to hear the case "for want of a substantial federal question".\nUndeterred, the couple tried again. This time they tried a different tack - Baker changed his name to the gender-neutral "Pat Lyn".\nA very simple manoeuvre, but it did the trick. The licence was issued and they began to plan a wedding. They asked a Methodist minister to perform the ceremony and went through weeks of pre-marital counselling like any heterosexual couple preparing for a Methodist wedding.\nBut with 24 hours to go, the minister changed his mind.\nThey needed another minister to step forward, says Pastor Roger Lynn, who worked alongside the couple at a drop-in centre offering support and counselling to gay people in Minneapolis.\n"It wasn\'t just a marriage… it was a social event in the gay community," says Lynn. The couple were planning to film the wedding, in order to get the word out to the national media.\nLynn remembers pronouncing the couple \'husband and husband\'\nLynn jumped at the chance to conduct the ceremony. At the time, his church had no rules against marrying people of the same sex, he says.\n"The Methodist church has always taken a strong stand on social issues… I expected that the progressive side of the church would support me."\nThe ceremony took place in an old Victorian home near a lake in Minneapolis.\n"There was a cake and rather than a bride and groom on the top, there were two grooms," Lynn says.\nHe remembers pronouncing the couple "husband and husband".\nHe says it was an emotional moment, "particularly when they kissed".\nDespite his work at the drop-in centre he\'d never seen two men kiss - and he says he had a "visceral reaction".\n"It was frightening," he says. "It forced me to come to terms with my own homophobia."\nAt the end of the ceremony, when many of the congregation came up to the pastor in tears, he says he knew he\'d done the right thing.\n"It was very clear that these two people were in love with each other, and they were a good balance," he says.\nAfter conducting Baker and McConnell\'s wedding ceremony, Lynn found his own marriage was in trouble. His wife wasn\'t happy about what he\'d done and was nervous about the attention it would bring. The following Sunday they attended church and the preacher leading the service vilified Lynn for performing the marriage.\nLynn was steadfast. "I thought it was funny," he says. "I knew some in the congregation supported me and I felt a little smug."\nBut soon afterwards he began to get hate mail from across the country. His notoriety was such that one letter reached him addressed simply to "gay hippy minister, Minneapolis".\nHe was fired from his job, but soon reinstated on appeal.\nHis marriage also ended, though not for this reason alone, he says.\nFor years afterwards fellow ministers tried to get him to change his mind about what he\'d done. But despite all these problems, Lynn - now retired and living in Minnesota - says he\'s never regretted his actions.\n"It defined who I am and if I had the chance to do it again, I\'d do it again," he says.\nJack Baker and Mike McConnell received many letters of support from across the world - from Brazil to India.\nOne postcard sent from Barbados read simply: "Congratulations on your courageous step! Hope your dreams come true and that life together will be as beautiful and happy as can be."\nThe couple still live together in Minneapolis. They consider themselves legally married as their licence has never been revoked.\nThey don\'t give interviews to the media now, but speaking on the David Susskind show in 1973, Baker described their attitude to same-sex marriage.\n"Gay couples will come into the relationship as two equal human beings and so you don\'t arbitrarily assume that because you have certain genitals you\'ll do a certain thing… heterosexuals should learn that one."\nRoger Lynn was interviewed for the BBC World Service programme Witness\nYou can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook

Our focus is on working together to deliver the nation\'s foremost youth program of character development and values-based leadership training. Somehow, Scouting has become one of the focal points in the debate on homosexuality. However, it is not the role of the Boy Scouts to resolve this complex issue, nor can the decision we will make today.\nIn 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the BSA has the right to set its membership standards. It is worth noting that the court\'s decision was not about whether homosexuality is right or wrong; rather, it affirmed that private organizations have the right to set membership rules based on their beliefs and values.\nAt the BSA\'s National Annual Meeting today, the 1,400 voting members of our National Council will vote on a proposed resolution that would end the restriction on gay youth membership. That\'s the right decision for Boy Scouts.\nDuty to God\nToday\'s proposed resolution reaffirms our core belief in doing one\'s "duty to God."

A bill banning workplace discrimination against gay and transgender people has passed a critical test of support in the US Senate, 17 years after a similar bill failed by a single vote.\nThe Democratic-led Senate voted 61-30 to open debate on the legislation, with several Republicans backing it.\nThe bill is expected to win final Senate passage as early as this week.\nThe White House strongly supports the measure, but its future in the Republican-led House remains unclear.\nThe Senate rejected comparable legislation by one vote in 1996.\nAmericans ought to be judged by one thing only in their workplaces: their ability to get their jobs doneBarack Obama, US President\nBut on Monday, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or Enda, received bipartisan support and reached the 60-vote threshold necessary to overcome a procedural roadblock set up by Republican opponents.\n\'Make a difference\'\nIn the House of Representatives, Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, has voiced opposition to the bill, saying it could lead to lawsuits and hinder job creation.\nThe proposed legislation bars employers with 15 or more workers from making employment decisions - hiring, firing or compensation - based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\nPresident Barack Obama has publicly voiced his support for the measure, three years after Congress lifted the ban on gays serving openly in the US military, and months after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage.\n"Americans ought to be judged by one thing only in their workplaces: their ability to get their jobs done,\'\' Mr Obama told the Huffington Post.\n"Does it make a difference if the fire-fighter who rescues you is gay, or the accountant who does your taxes or the mechanic who fixes your car?"

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Worried they could be sued by gay couples, some churches are changing their bylaws to reflect their view that the Bible allows only marriage between one man and one woman.\nAlthough there have been lawsuits against wedding industry businesses that refuse to serve gay couples, attorneys promoting the bylaw changes say they don\'t know of any lawsuits against churches.\nCritics say the changes are unnecessary, but some churches fear that it\'s only a matter of time before one of them is sued.\n"I thought marriage was always between one man and one woman, but the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision said no," said Gregory S. Erwin, an attorney for the Louisiana Baptist Convention, an association of Southern Baptist churches and one several groups advising churches to change their bylaws. "I think it\'s better to be prepared because the law is changing. America is changing."\nIn a June decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as between a man and a woman for purposes of federal law. A second decision was more technical but essentially ushered in legal gay marriage in California.\nKevin Snider is an attorney with the Pacific Justice Institute, a nonprofit legal defense group that specializes in conservative Christian issues. His organization released a model marriage policy a few years ago in response to a statewide gay marriage fight in California. Snider said some religious leaders have been threatened with lawsuits for declining to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies.\nDean Inserra, head pastor of the 1,000-member City Church Tallahassee, based in Florida, said he does not want to be alarmist, but his church is looking into how best to address the issue.\nInserra said he already has had to say no to gay friends who wanted him to perform a wedding ceremony.\n"We have some gay couples that attend our church. What happens when they ask us to do their wedding?" Inserra said. "What happens when we say no? Is it going to be treated like a civil rights thing?"\nCritics, including some gay Christian leaders, argue that the changes amount to a solution looking for a problem.\n"They seem to be under the impression that there is this huge movement with the goal of forcing them to perform ceremonies that violate their freedom of religion," said Justin Lee, executive director of the Gay Christian Network, a nonprofit that provides support for gay Christians and their friends and families and encourages churches to be more welcoming.\n"If anyone tried to force a church to perform a ceremony against their will, I would be the first person to stand up in that church\'s defense."\nThirteen states and the District of Columbia now recognize gay marriage.\nSome Christian denominations, such as the United Church of Christ, accept gay marriage. The Episcopal Church recently approved a blessing for same-sex couples, but each bishop must decide whether to allow the ceremony in his or her local diocese.\nThe majority of Christian denominations, however, view homosexual relationships as sinful. In more hierarchical denominations, like the Roman Catholic Church or the United Methodist Church, individual churches are bound by the policies of the larger denomination. But nondenominational churches and those loosely affiliated with more established groups often individually decide how to address social issues such as gay marriage.\nEric Rassbach is an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a public interest legal group that defends the free expression rights of all faiths. He said it is unlikely the government would try to force a pastor to perform a same-sex marriage, but churches that rent out their facilities to the general public could face problems if they refuse to rent to gay couples.\nAlthough his organization has not advocated it, he said it could strengthen a church\'s legal position to adopt a statement explaining its beliefs about marriage.\n"A number of groups don\'t have a written doctrine," Rassbach said. "Say a group like the Primitive Baptists — they don\'t want a written-down credo, but the courts like written-down things."\nRassbach said it was important for churches to get their beliefs in writing before a dispute arises, otherwise it can look to a court as if something was done after the fact as an attempt to cover up hostility to gays.\nAirline Baptist Church Senior Pastor Chad Mills said members of the public use their facilities in Bossier City, La., for many activities, including Zumba classes. In the past, anyone who could pay the fee was allowed to reserve the space. But recently, the church changed its rental policy to allow wedding-related events only for male-female couples.\nSome denominations are less concerned about the Supreme Court rulings. The Assemblies of God, the group of churches comprising the world\'s largest Pentecostal denomination, sought legal advice after the rulings. An attorney for the group distributed a memo to ministers saying there was no reason to change their bylaws.\nHowever, the memo also said that "doing so is not inappropriate, and may be warranted based on future rulings by the Supreme Court and other state and federal courts."\nThe bylaw changes are coming at a time when many churches are wrestling with gay marriage in general and are working hard to be more welcoming to gays and lesbians.\n"It\'s probably one of the most difficult issues our churches are facing right now," said Doug Anderson, a national coordinator with the evangelical Vineyard Church. "It\'s almost an impossible situation to reconcile what\'s going on in our culture, and our whole theology of welcoming and loving people, versus what it says in the Bible."

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Hundreds of supporters of same-sex marriage rights assembled at the Rhode Island Statehouse on Tuesday, urging lawmakers to make the nation\'s smallest state the 10th to allow gay and lesbian couples to wed — and the last to do so in New England.\nHouse Speaker Gordon Fox, who is gay, has called for a vote on same-sex marriage legislation in his chamber by month\'s end, making Rhode Island the latest state to address an issue whose supporters see things swinging their way after voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington approved gay marriage last fall.\nAbout 300 supporters and opponents signed up to address the legislative committee reviewing the bill — they were limited to 2 minutes each to keep the hearing from going all night — while hundreds more gathered in the hallways outside the hearing.\nDownstairs, a raucous rally of gay-marriage opponents beneath the Statehouse rotunda at times drowned out those testifying in the third-floor committee room.\n"I\'d like us to get on the right side of history," said Josephine O\'Connell, 71, of Providence, who said it "breaks her heart" that her home state is the only one in New England that doesn\'t allow gays and lesbians like her to marry. "I don\'t want to be looking back in 20 years, thinking \'what were we thinking?\'"\nGov. Lincoln Chafee, an independent, and Treasurer Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, both spoke out in favor of gay marriage at the hearing.\n"I\'m here as your treasurer, but I\'m really here as a mother and wife," said Raimondo. "Every Rhode Islander deserves the same rights that we have."\nHundreds of others showed up to urge lawmakers in this heavily Catholic state to drop the legislation and protect the current definition of marriage.\nThe Roman Catholic Church opposes the legislation on religious grounds — and more practical ones. The Rev. Bernard Healey told lawmakers that the Providence Diocese is concerned Catholic schools and charitable organizations could be forced to change their employee benefit policies if compelled to recognize the same-sex spouses of employees.\n"We are here to defend and support the longstanding definition of marriage... as the exclusive and lasting relationship of a man and a woman," Healey said. "Using the law to alter or redefine marriage is an injustice to those who have embraced this way of life."\nOthers warned that allowing gay marriage would erode social norms.\n"Just because these states in New England have decided to redefine marriage doesn\'t mean we should follow them down this path," said Michael Krzywonos of Pawtucket. "The polygamists will be next in line. Then we\'ll begin to test the boundaries of what age is permissible. And then we will test whether love and marriage can only be between two people."\nSupporters are hoping to build on national momentum following the votes in Maine, Maryland and Washington. Meanwhile, in Minnesota, voters rejected a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have prohibited gay marriage, the first time such a ballot question has failed in the United States.\nLawmakers in Illinois are also expected to consider gay marriage this year.\nSupporters in Rhode Island expect the measure will pass the Democrat-controlled House but concede the state Senate is more challenging. Senate President Teresa Paiva Weed, a Newport Democrat, is a gay marriage opponent but has said she will allow a committee vote on the legislation should it pass the House. She said Tuesday that she would not vote for the legislation as it\'s currently written.\nState lawmakers have passed civil unions for gay couples, and Chafee signed an executive order recognizing gay marriages performed in other states.

So saith Adam Liptak in a news analysis piece in the New York Times today. As he writes, last June\'s decisions were very carefully calibrated:\nThe Supreme Court’s two decisions in June were finely balanced, with legal experts saying they had achieved the twin goals of advancing the cause of gay rights and avoiding a backlash in parts of the country not ready to embrace same-sex marriage.\nBut it hasn\'t worked. In June, 9 states and the District of Columbia embraced marriage equality; today, just six months later, the count is now 17, with challenges coming from Utah and Ohio.\nHow this has worked, with analysis from the pundits who thought this had been put to bed for a while, below the great orange wedding bouquet.\nFirst, we have Professor Michael Dorf from Cornell Law School:\n“If the court thought it was going to get a few years, I think they were naïve.”\nDorf, of course, thinks that the lower court and the 10th Circuit should have issued a stay. Now that several hundred couples have been married in Utah, that seems more moot than the several hundred couples San Francisco married in 2004.\nProfessor Dorf said there are probably not five votes on the Supreme Court to block Judge Shelby’s ruling. “On the strictly legal argument,” he said, “it’s hard to justify granting a stay.”\nBut he added that the lower courts should have done so, partly because of the potential cruelty of voiding the new marriages and partly because the Supreme Court is hard to predict.\n“It’s pretty clear that even the five justices who are sympathetic to same-sex marriage would rather take a few years before getting there,” Professor Dorf wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. “If their hand is forced, as it now will be, it’s impossible to say with certainty what they’ll do.”\n"Would rather." What a pity they\'re being rushed. Liptak doesn\'t see this as an issue for this term, but sees it for the session that begins in October 2015 (which is what I\'ve been saying) by which time that will be several thousand couples in Utah, not several hundred, and several hundred, no doubt, in Idaho and Colorado and Wyoming because Utah is closer than, say, New Mexico or Iowa.\nAnd, yes, Liptak points out that the Utah decision was based on a sentence in Scalia\'s dissent on the Windsor case\n“The view that this court will take of state prohibition of same-sex marriage is indicated beyond mistaking by today’s opinion”\nas GrafZeppelin127 and Kalil pointed out here when the decision was published, a gesture, that, as Liptak reports,\ndid not impress Jason Mazzone, a law professor at the University of Illinois. “His opinion would have appeared considerably more judicial had he resisted the urge to give Justice Scalia the finger,” Professor Mazzone wrote in a blog post last Friday.\nWell, okay!\nBut Michael Klarman, a historian at Harvard Law School, now thinks two to six years, even with the current composition of the court. He doesn\'t think it\'s open-ended any more.\nSo, Utah has set the wheels in motion for the endgame. Illinois, Oregon and New Jersey are in the pipeline now. Historically, this is a QUICK process, as we remember that Prop 8 was only five years ago. Of course, the Supreme Court COULD have done this sooner by accepting the Ninth Circuit\'s decision on Prop 8, a decision that is now lost to them, but I think I can wait a couple of years.\nNow, our task is to change the composition of the House so we can get ENDA passed and signed.

Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman announces his support of legalizing gay marriage\nOnly current U.S. Senator and one of just a few members of Congress to support gay marriage\nGay son encouraged Portman to switch his position\nWASHINGTON — Republican Sen. Rob Portman said Thursday that he now supports gay marriage — a surprise turnabout on a hot-button social issue, sparked by a deeply personal reflection that began two years ago after Portman\'s son, Will, told him that he is gay.\n"It\'s a change of heart from the position of a father," Portman told three Ohio reporters on Thursday during a 45-minute interview in his office. "I think we should be allowing gay couples the joy and stability of marriage."\nPortman\'s endorsement of gay marriage makes him the only sitting Republican senator to hold that position. But it comes at a time when public attitudes are shifting quickly on the issue, and more and more states are sanctioning gay marriage.\nOhio\'s junior senator outlined his position in the interview, and in an op-ed that appears Friday in The Columbus Dispatch.\n"I have come to believe that if two people are prepared to make a lifetime commitment to love and care for each other in good times and bad, the government shouldn\'t deny them the opportunity to get married," Portman writes in the op-ed. "This isn\'t how I\'ve always felt."\nPortman said his own evolution on the issue began in 2011, when Will, then a freshman at Yale University, made a stunning revelation.\n"Will … came to Jane and me and announced that he was gay, that it was not a choice. It was who he is and he had been that way since he could remember," Portman recalled of the conversation. "Jane and I were both surprised, very surprised, but also very supportive of him. Our reaction was not about policy or positions. It was about him as a son and letting him know we were 110% supportive of him."\nHis son\'s homosexuality "allowed me to think about this issue from a new perspective, and that\'s as a dad who loves his son a lot," Portman said. He said he wants Will to have the same chance at an enduring relationship, "like Jane and I have had for over 26 years."\nPortman — who until now said marriage should only be between a man and a woman — said it took him "a while" to make the political shift and "get comfortable" supporting gay marriage.\nPortman was among those who, as a member of the House in 1996, voted in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defines marriage as between a man and a woman and bars federal recognition of same-sex marriage. It also says states can\'t be forced to recognize a same-sex marriage performed in another state. Portman also voted in favor of a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage when he was in the House.\n"Rob believes marriage is a sacred bond between one man and one woman," Portman\'s spokesman told The Cincinnati Enquirer in 2011. At the time, Portman was the target of a protest by University of Michigan Law School students. He had been invited to deliver the school\'s commencement address, but nearly 300 students, angry about Portman\'s opposition to gay rights, asked the school to revoke the invitation.\nOn Thursday, Portman said he would like to see Congress repeal the provision of DOMA that bans federal recognition of same-sex marriage, although he still supports the part of the law that says states should not be forced to recognize same-sex marriages.\n"I\'m of the view that the states ought to be deciding this issue, and frankly that\'s happening increasingly," Portman said.\nPortman, who is Methodist, said he did not come to this new position easily or quickly. He talked to his pastor and other religious leaders. He talked to his family, friends, and political allies. He talked to those who support gay marriage, including former vice president Dick Cheney — as well as those who do not, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n"I have had a process and a journey," he said. "I\'ve done a lot of reading. I\'ve done a lot of talking to folks."\nAsked whether he would support overturning Ohio\'s state ban on same-sex marriage if it comes up in a voter referendum, Portman said yes.\n"I\'m going to be supportive of Ohioans having the opportunity to marry," he said. "I would not plan to take a leadership role in this, but people will know my position."\nOther Republicans have similarly embraced same-sex marriage. For example, more than 80 prominent Republicans — including ex-governors, former members of Congress and veterans of the George W. Bush administration — are planning to file a "friend of the court" brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down California\'s Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage.\nThe signers include former governors Jon Huntsman of Utah, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, and William Weld of Massachusetts.\nBut many Republicans in Congress, including House Speaker John Boehner, remain fiercely opposed to same-sex marriage. And the issue ignites strong passions among social conservatives, a key base for Portman in Ohio.\nPortman said Will, who is now 21, nudged him to change his views and wanted him to publicly declare his support for gay marriage. "He hasn\'t pushed me, but he\'s been encouraging, and he\'s been very much involved," he said.\nPortman said his previous views on marriage were rooted in his faith. But "the overriding message of love and compassion that I take from the Bible . . . and the fact that I believe we are all created by our maker . . . that has all influenced me in terms of my change on this issue," he said.\nPortman said he concluded that marriage as an institution would be strengthened by allowing gay couples to wed.\n"When two people make a commitment to one another, it can actually enhance the institution of marriage," he said.\nEven as he endorsed same-sex marriage, Portman said this would not suddenly become a top legislative priority for him. He has no plans, for example, to introduce legislation to repeal elements of DOMA or take on any other gay rights issues.\n"I\'m kind of an economic policy wonk," he said. "That\'s how I got into this business. That\'s been my priority and my focus, and it will continue to be."\nPortman said he wanted to announce his position now, in part because the Supreme Court will hear arguments on DOMA later this month.\n"I felt it was important to let my constituents know where I stand because these court cases are going to encourage members of the media to ask senators and House members what their position is," Portman said, adding that he wanted "to do this before the politics of these court decisions . . . makes it more difficult maybe to have an honest discussion."\nPortman said he\'s told some of his Republican colleagues about his shift and all of them have been very "respectful" of his decision, even if they don\'t agree.\nHe consulted Cheney, whose daughter is gay, about the issue last weekend, when they were both attending a conference. "His advice was \'Do the right thing. Follow your heart,\' " Portman said.\nAsked how this might affect his political career, Portman, who has been touted as a possible 2016 presidential candidate, said he had no idea.\n"That has nothing to do with my decision," he said. "This was personally and family initiated, and then it was a process of carefully thinking through the issue."

Usually when we talk about the 1936 Olympics in Berlin we focus on two men -- Adolf Hitler and Jesse Owens -- and rightfully so. They are the two with an undeniable impact on history, albeit in vastly different ways.\nBut in light of President Barack Obama\'s recent remarks on "The Tonight Show" denouncing Russia\'s new anti-gay laws, laws that have led to bloodshed in the streets, it is important that we remember Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller.\nThey too were at those games. They too left a mark.\nYou see, the day before they were scheduled to run in the 400-meter relay, their coach, Dean Cromwell, replaced them.\nThey were not injured.\nThey did not break any team rules nor were they disqualified for any violations.\nThey were, however, Jewish, and this was Nazi Germany, which had adopted the Nuremberg laws limiting Jewish citizens\' rights a year earlier. Apparently, Cromwell, along with leaders from the U.S. Olympic Committee, decided it would be best if Glickman and Stoller did not compete.\nAt the time I\'m sure it seemed like a decision that would only hurt the two men. After all, the 400, led by Owens, still won gold.\nToday we know better.\nToday we look at that decision and lower our heads in shame, understanding that it made us complicit with something that evolved into a far worse crime than unjustly replacing a pair of sprinters. In the moment when we should have spoken up, we remained silent.\nAnd so here we are again: an Olympics on the horizon, another host country with recently legislated laws persecuting a group of people, and for a while, we were silent. And then Tuesday happened.\n"I\'ve been very clear that when it comes to universal rights, when it comes to people\'s basic freedoms, that whether you are discriminating on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, you are violating the basic morality that I think should transcend every country," Obama said, going on to talk about how Russia\'s treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people goes against the spirit of the Olympics.\nHe did not call for a boycott.\nBut on Wednesday he canceled a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin planned for September. The White House cited Russia\'s decision to grant asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and "lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control" among other reasons. But it also mentioned human rights issues.\nRecently, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry received a letter from 88 members of Congress -- Republicans and Democrats -- urging him to do something to guarantee the safety of LGBT Americans visiting Russia during that time. That leaves 447 lawmakers we should be asking why they did not sign that letter.\nLast month Buzzfeed provided the world photos of LGBT people being violently beaten by anti-gay protesters and police in Russia.\nThere are reports of LGBT teens being kidnapped, bullied, tortured and killed.\nRussian officials have said they don\'t condone the attacks, but police have stood by while they happened and then arrested the battered victims for being gay. And because it is unclear whether or not the anti-gay laws will be enforced during the Olympics, the safety of all Americans -- because you can be arrested if police think you look gay or even if you support gays -- is in question.\nWhich brings me to: Why aren\'t the names of all 535 members of Congress on that letter?\nIn talking about the 1936 Olympics, I do not equate what is happening in Russia to what happened to Jewish people during World War II. I just want to remind you that the Holocaust did not happen overnight. It was subtle.\nSurgical.\nIn silence.\nThese new anti-gay laws are disturbingly similar to the anti-Semitic Nuremberg laws Hitler passed before the 1936 Olympics. And with the Pew Institute finding 84% of Russians believe society should reject gay people, perhaps some saying they object to gays for fear of arrest, the world should question how far Russia intends to go.\nWe should question how far Russia, our lukewarm ally, intends to go and what our participation in the 2014 Olympic Games will look like generations from now.\nIn one of his final interviews before passing away in 2001, Glickman told the San Diego Jewish Press-Heritage that there had been some talk of boycotting the 1936 Olympics because of Hitler, but no one foresaw what would happen to the Jews a short time later.\n"There is no way in the world that I would think of going to Nazi Germany," he said. "The Holocaust and those things around Nazi Germany which we all loathe weren\'t in existence in 1936."\nNo one can predict the future. But this week Obama showed he learned an important lesson from our Olympic past -- offering silence to appease evil is a senseless endeavor because evil will never be satisfied. Now it\'s our turn to speak up. There are 447 members of Congress who have yet to sign that letter to Kerry -- we need to be asking why.\nPhotos: Wrecking homes for an Olympic highway\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.\nJoin us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

In a preview of a major constitutional showdown at the Supreme Court over same-sex marriage, the Obama administration said on Friday that a federal law denying financial benefits to legally wed gay and lesbian couples is unconstitutional.\nThe Justice Department filed the first of a series of briefs in a pair of cases dealing with the multilayered issue, outlining the executive branch\'s positions.\nThe high court will hear oral arguments next month on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), a 1996 congressional law that says for federal purposes, marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman.\nThat means federal tax, Social Security, pension, and bankruptcy benefits, and family medical leave protections -- do not apply to gay and lesbian couples.\nThis case deals with Edith "Edie" Windsor, forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than other married couples would have to pay. Because her decades-long partner was a woman, the federal government did not recognize the same-sex marriage in legal terms, even though their home state of New York did.\nBut now, led by President Barack Obama\'s recent political about-face, the administration opposes the law.\n"Moral opposition to homosexuality, though it may reflect deeply held personal views, is not a legitimate policy objective that can justify unequal treatment of gay and lesbian people" contained in the DOMA law, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said in the Justice Department\'s legal brief.\nThe separate case from California deals with Proposition 8, a 2008 voter-approved referendum banning same-sex marriage. This after the California high court had earlier concluded same-sex couples could legally wed. That case too will be heard in late March.\nThough not a party in the California case, government sources say the Justice Department was prepared next week to file an "amicus" or supporting brief asserting a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, and that Proposition 8 should be struck down as a violation of constitutionally guaranteed "equal protection" of the laws.\nThose sources say Obama was expected to make the final call on whether to intervene in the state dispute.\n"I have to make sure that I\'m not interjecting myself too much in this process, particularly when we\'re not a party to the case," Obama said Wednesday in an interview with CNN affiliate KGO-TV in San Francisco.\nOf more immediate concern was the DOMA fight, where the administration is squarely involved. But a tricky gateway or "jurisdictional" question threatens to stall any final consideration of the law\'s constitutionality. That was the focus of much of the Friday legal papers.\nTraditionally, that role would fall to the solicitor general\'s office. But Obama, in an election-year stunner, said last May that he supported same-sex marriage.\nThe president had already ordered Attorney General Eric Holder not to defend DOMA in court. That raised the question of whether any party could rightfully step in and defend the law.\nBesides the constitutional issue, the justices had specifically ordered both sides to argue a supplemental question: whether congressional Republicans -- operating officially as the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives -- have "standing" or legal authority to make the case.\nLawyers representing the House GOP said Friday that they should be able to take the lead and defend the law, since both Windsor and the Obama administration are taking the same legal position.\n"Without the House\'s participation," said attorney Paul Clement, representing House leaders, "it is hard to see how there is any case or controversy here at all. Both Ms. Windsor and the executive agree that DOMA is unconstitutional and that Ms. Windsor was entitled to a [tax] refund. And the lower courts granted them all the relief they requested. Only the House\'s intervention provides the adverseness that Article III [federal court jurisdiction] demands."\n"House Republicans lack "any basis for supplanting the executive branch\'s exclusive role in representing the United States\' interests in this litigation, and has no interests of its own that would satisfy" federal court scrutiny, said administration lawyers.\nWindsor\'s legal team also said the House leaders could defend DOMA, at least partially, suggesting the woman wants ultimate resolution on the constitutional questions as soon as possible.\n"I was devastated by the loss of the great love of my life, and I was also very sick, then had to deal with pulling together enough money to pay for the taxes," the 83-year-old Windsor told CNN recently. "And it was deeply upsetting."\nIn November, three states -- Maryland, Washington, and Maine -- approved same-sex marriage, adding to the six states and the District of Columbia that already have done so. Minnesota voters also rejected an effort to ban such unions through a constitutional amendment.\nAs more states legalize same-sex marriage, one of the key questions the justices may be forced to address is whether a national consensus now exists supporting the idea of expanding an "equal protection" right of marriage to homosexuals.\nA bill known as the Respect for Marriage Act is working its way through Congress and would repeal DOMA.\nThat law does not prohibit states from allowing same-sex marriages, but it also does not force states to recognize them from other states. Most of the current plaintiffs are federal workers, who are not allowed to add their spouses to health care plans, and other benefits.\nMany other states, including New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, Rhode Island and Hawaii, have legalized domestic partnerships and civil unions for such couples -- a step designed in most cases to provide the same rights of marriage under state law.\nBut other states have passed laws or state constitutional amendments banning such marriages. California\'s Proposition 8 is the only such referendum that revoked the right after lawmakers and the state courts previously allowed it. That makes it a somewhat unique legal case for review by the justices.

The Presidential Inauguration Committee announced Tuesday that the President Obama has selected Pastor Louie Giglio of the Georgia-based Passion City Church to deliver the benediction for his second inauguration. In a mid-1990s sermon identified as Giglio’s, available online on a Christian training Web site, he preached rabidly anti-LGBT views. The 54-minute sermon, entitled “In Search of a Standard – Christian Response to Homosexuality,” advocates for dangerous “ex-gay” therapy for gay and lesbian people, references a biblical passage often interpreted to require gay people be executed, and impels Christians to “firmly respond to the aggressive agenda” and prevent the “homosexual lifestyle”\nI can tell you that one of the most hurtful parts of the first Obama administration was asking to have Rick Warren speak at his inaugural. He was giving a platform to someone who spread hate, when there were so many other choices there. It was greatly resented by many in the LGBT community. In fact, it set off a chain of events (Rev. Robinson "accidentally" not being shown on live TV etc.) which got Obama off on very bad footing with many in the LGBT community.\nFollowing McClurkin, I was very angry with Obama. Then came Warren. But apparently Obama/the inaugural team haven\'t learned anything:\nFrom above Alternet piece:\n(17:37) Men, women, I can’t say anything other to you tonight than this, that if you look at the counsel of the word of God, Old Testament, New Testament, you come quickly to the conclusion that homosexuality is not an alternate lifestyle… homosexuality is not just a sexual preference homosexuality is not gay, but homosexuality is sin. It is sin in the eyes of God, and it is sin according to the word of God. You come to only one conclusion: homosexuality is less than God’s best for his creation. It is less than God’s best for us and everything in our lives that is less than God’s best for us and his plan for us and his design for us, is sin. That’s God’s voice. If you want to hear God’s voice, that is his voice to this issue of homosexuality. It is not ambiguous and unclear. It is very clear.\nThere are numerous other very incendiary quotes.\nSo let me address the naysayers now:\n- But Obama has done so much for LGBT rights, it\'s just a speaker at the Inauguration\nUm, first, if you are trying to make improving LGBT rights a cornerstone of your presidency, you don\'t have to spit in the eye of the people you are supposedly trying to help. This is a PERSONAL choice. Hagel I can somewhat justify because there are other plusses to his candidacy. This is Obama picking yet another bigot when there could be much better choices out there who were/are not so vehemently anti-gay\nAlso, when will he get past this bullshit of making in-roads with these people? These people will always vote against him and his agenda. Why give the marquee moment to a hater\n- But, but he said those things long ago\nYeah, and those are the seeds of hatred which were sown in the very people today who support discrimination against LGBT people.\nAlso, if Shirley Sherrod is up for scrutiny for what she didn\'t even say, Hagel for his homophobic remarks, they why should this guy not be held accountable, as would anything with a history of anti-African American, anti-woman, anti-Hispanic, anti- remarks. Yeah, the times are changing and its time for the haters and the Vichy apologists to be held accountable for hating when it was a much bigger trend.\nAnd for what it\'s worth, I am against Hagel ALSO for this reason. As Maddow pointed out, there will be many, many issues involving LGBT people in the military coming up. So he should answer for his bigotry then. Yet another reason why he is a bad choice.\n- But, but, Obama has a GAY CUBAN poet speaking\nAnd this argument pisses me off most of all. In Obama and Co\'s mind, if you put up a minority group, that cancels out, makes ok having the hater up there. No, it doesn\'t. You don\'t have a "mixed program" by putting up people who have advanced society, like Ms. Evers and those who have held it back. Once again, we\'ll likely have an inauguration with the usual symbolic winks and nods to the LGBT community while the hater gets a front row seat.\nStarting off Obama II in a sucky way, like he started off Obama I. Except he can\'t blame Boehner for this one. A fucking huge disappointment.

Lawmakers approved gay marriage Tuesday in a historic vote that saw supporters overcome cultural, racial and geographic divides and put Illinois in line with a growing number of states that have extended the right to wed to same-sex couples.\nAfter more than a year of intense lobbying by both sides, gay lawmakers made emotional pleas to colleagues to give their families equal rights even as opponents argued that doing so would unravel the foundation of society.\n"At the end of the day, what this bill is about is love, it\'s about family, it\'s about commitment," said sponsoring Rep. Greg Harris, clutching an American flag he said was sent by a supportive soldier stationed in Afghanistan.\n"At the end of the day, this bill is about the vision that the founders of our country had and wrote into our Constitution, where they said America is a journey. … And we\'ll continue to walk down that road to make America a better place, to make ourselves a \'more perfect union,\' to ensure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity," the Chicago Democrat said.\nGov. Pat Quinn said he intends to sign the bill, which would take effect June 1. It\'s the Democratic governor\'s latest step in taking Illinois in a more liberal direction. Under Quinn in the past three years, Illinois has banned the death penalty, legalized medical marijuana, provided driver\'s licenses for undocumented immigrants and approved civil unions.\nResolving the gay marriage question also allows state leaders to get a divisive issue off their plates before next year\'s big statewide election, even as long-standing financial issues headlined by the state\'s $100 billion public worker pension shortfall remain unresolved.\n"Michelle and I are overjoyed for all the committed couples in Illinois whose love will now be as legal as ours — and for their friends and family who have long wanted nothing more than to see their loved ones treated fairly and equally under the law," Obama said in a statement.\nThe vote Tuesday capped a year in which prospects for gay marriage often were dim. The proposal failed in a January lame-duck session, but the Illinois Senate provided new hope on Valentine\'s Day by passing the measure. There was no House vote at the end of spring session in late May, leaving both sides to spend the summer and fall lobbying lawmakers. The first week of veto session came and went without a vote last month, and with candidate filing for next year\'s election just weeks away, some expected no resolution until next year.\nBut the bill got 61 votes, one more than the minimum needed to send it back to the Senate for a final signoff later Tuesday.\nSupporters said efforts to pick up votes were boosted by events that unfolded since May, the first being the U.S. Supreme Court\'s landmark ruling that struck down the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman for the purpose of receiving federal benefits.\nWhile hailed as a major victory, the move created a situation in which gay couples living in states that recognize same-sex marriage have more rights than their counterparts in states that haven\'t legalized gay marriage. The two-class system was a clear narrative that advocates could use when lobbying lawmakers who were on the fence, contending it just didn\'t make sense for gay couples in Illinois to be denied access to benefits that were available to couples living just across the border in Iowa.\nAdvocates soon received additional help from Pope Francis, who warned that the Catholic Church could lose its way by focusing too much on social stances, including opposition to homosexuality.\n"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge him?" Francis said in July.\nThe comments sparked a wave of soul-searching by several Catholic lawmakers who had battled to reconcile their religious beliefs with their sworn duty to represent their constituents who were increasingly supportive of gay rights even as Cardinal Francis George remained opposed.\n"As a Catholic follower of Jesus and the pope, Pope Francis, I am clear that our Catholic religious doctrine has at its core love, compassion and justice for all people," said Rep. Linda Chapa LaVia, a Democrat from Aurora who voted for the bill after spending much of the summer undecided.\n"For those that just happen to be gay — living in a very harmonious, productive relationship but illegal — who am I to judge that they should be illegal?" the speaker said.\nMadigan had come under fire from some gay rights groups who argued that he wasn\'t doing enough to build support in the chamber he controls, but advocates say he was critical in rounding up the final needed votes in the last several weeks.\nIn addition, African-American lawmakers who had been divided on the issue provided some key votes in favor, and three House Republicans came onboard.\nThe speaker gave much credit to Harris, the bill\'s sponsor, saying he was steadfast in the face of "unwarranted criticism" from some in the gay community who were not happy with the way Harris was handling the bill. Some activists had demanded Harris call the bill whether the support was there, contending failure to do so should result in his resignation. Madigan said those efforts "did not help the passage of the bill, it probably hurt the passage of the bill."\n"Often you have to take a long view and say, \'This is where we need to go, this is the destination,\'" he said.\nUnder the measure, the definition of marriage in Illinois would change from an act between a man and a woman to one between two people. Once signed, civil unions could be converted to marriages within a year of the law going on the books. The legislation would not require religious organizations to wed gay couples, and church officials would not be forced to allow gay couples seeking to marry to use their facilities.\nBut opponents say the bill doesn\'t go far enough to protect religious rights. For example, they contend religious groups may be forced to provide health insurance to an employee\'s same-sex spouse. Others say the bill offers no protections for people like bakers, florists and wedding photographers who may oppose same-sex marriage and could open themselves up to legal action for refusing to provide services.\nThe vote was expected to be so tight that Rep. Naomi Jakobsson, an Urbana Democrat, rushed to Springfield from her home where she said she was caring for an ill relative. Jakobsson, a co-sponsor of the legislation, made it to the House floor shortly after the debate started. One lawmaker, Democratic Rep. Emily McAsey from Lockport, brought her infant onto the floor.

WASHINGTON (AP) — When the Supreme Court struck down part of an anti-gay marriage law, Justice Anthony Kennedy took pains in his majority opinion to say the ruling applied only to legally married same-sex couples seeking benefits from the federal government.\nBut judges and lawyers representing same-sex couples are already using Kennedy\'s language and reasoning in other cases about the right to marry.\nIt\'s a predictable next step in a long-term, incremental legal strategy that is being used at both the state and federal levels, and in state legislatures and executive mansions as well as the courts, to build public and official acceptance of gay marriage. Much the same approach was used decades ago by civil rights lawyers fighting state-sanctioned discrimination; one decision becomes a steppingstone to the next.\nIn the fight over gay marriage, Kennedy\'s words also figured in an earlier example. He insisted in June 2003 that his opinion overturning state sodomy laws had nothing to do with governments\' recognition of same-sex marriage. Five months later, language from his opinion showed up in the second paragraph of a state court ruling that made Massachusetts the first state to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry.\nIn the June 26 decision in U.S. v. Windsor, Kennedy said the provision denying federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples relegates those marriages to second-class status, and "it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples."\nHe framed his argument with reference to states\' "historic and essential authority to define the marital relation."\nBut it doesn\'t take too much creativity to reframe his opinion to challenge state bans on same-sex marriage, said Jon Davidson, legal director of the gay rights group Lambda Legal.\n"It\'s stigmatizing and it\'s harmful to people and particularly harmful to children when their parents\' relationship is treated as inferior by the government. Those points are points we will be making in all of our marriage cases," Davidson said.\nDavidson\'s group is relying on the invalidation of the Defense of Marriage Act provision in a state lawsuit to force New Jersey to allow same-sex couples to wed. In that case, the new argument is that the New Jersey Constitution does not allow the state to essentially keep same-sex couples from receiving federal benefits by prohibiting them from marrying.\nLike the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, other state court rulings in favor of gay marriage have relied on provisions of their state constitutions. That has not happened by accident. The litigation plan had been to pursue marriage in liberal states, based on state constitutions, and generally avoid federal courts where judges appointed by conservative Republican presidents had, until recently, been in the majority.\nFederal courts in California are so far the only ones that have said that a state same-sex marriage ban violates the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court did not decide that issue one way or the other in its gay marriage rulings, and instead relied on a technical legal argument to resolve the California case and clear the way for same-sex marriage in the state, which resumed at the end of June.\nSame-sex marriage is legal, or soon will be, in 13 states and the District of Columbia, representing about 30% of the U.S. population. The states are: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.\nBut now federal challenges are popping up as well, in Nevada, Hawaii and Michigan, among other states.\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which struck down the California prohibition on same-sex marriage, will consider the Hawaii and Nevada bans together, but that case is in its early stages.\nIn Michigan, a federal judge prominently cited the Windsor decision in allowing a challenge to the state\'s marriage ban and its prohibition on same-sex couples jointly adopting children to go forward.\nU.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, quoted Kennedy in concluding that "plaintiffs are entitled to their day in court and they shall have it."\nA separate case in Michigan also "might cast a large shadow over a state law limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples," Georgetown University law professor Marty Lederman wrote on scotusblog.com.\nIn this March 6, 2013 file photo Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy speaks in Sacramento, Calif. (Photo: Rich Pedroncelli, AP)\nIn that dispute, public employees are challenging a Michigan law that cuts off domestic partner benefits for unmarried couples.\nU.S. District Judge David Lawson, appointed by President Bill Clinton, partly relied on the recent Supreme Court case in saying, "It is hard to argue with a straight face that the primary purpose, indeed, perhaps the sole purpose, of the statute is other than to deny health benefits to the same-sex partners of public employees. But that can never be a legitimate governmental purpose." Lawson blocked the law for now, pending a trial.\nWhen civil rights lawyers began their decadeslong quest to end official discrimination against black Americans, they pursued cases in state and federal courts that typically stopped short of the ultimate goal of overturning the Supreme Court decree in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 that "separate but equal" treatment of the races was permitted by the Constitution.\nIn a series of cases, the court chipped away at discrimination in higher education, including its 1950 decision in Sweatt v. Painter that said the University of Texas had to admit a black student to its law school because the one it created for black students did not offer an equivalent education. But even in June 1950, the court refused to re-examine the Plessy case.\nFour more years elapsed before the court issued its seminal ruling in Brown v. Board of Education outlawing discrimination in public schools.\nThe prominent odd-couple lawyers who brought the California case to the Supreme Court, Republican Theodore Olson and Democrat David Boies, hoped the court would in one fell swoop get rid of 30 state constitutional bans on gay marriage and a few state statutes and declare that the right to marry cannot be abridged on the basis of sexual orientation and gender.\nThey failed to win that big victory, although their clients got married two days after the court decision.\nFor a time, Olson and Boies were at odds with many gay rights advocates who feared that asking the court to rule too broadly too soon could backfire. It turned out that the California case helped focus attention on gay marriage and perhaps sped up the shift in public opinion that now shows a majority in favor of same-sex marriage in most polls.\nThe different approaches have sometimes coexisted uneasily. That, too, is reminiscent of the civil rights movement, said Harvard Law School professor Mark Tushnet, who has written about the legal strategy of civil rights lawyers. "There were lawsuits that the NAACP didn\'t want because they were seen as sure losers, but local lawyers went ahead and brought them anyway. They weren\'t part of the plan," Tushnet said.\nTen years ago, 13 states still had laws against sodomy when the court said that states have no right to intrude on the private, personal conduct of people, regardless of sexual orientation.\nInterracial marriage still was illegal in 16 states in 1967 before the high court outlawed race-based state marriage bans.\nIn 1954, when the court issued its landmark Brown decision, 17 states had formally segregated school systems.\nNo one is sure what the magic number needs to be for the court to set a nationwide rule. Tushnet predicts that when roughly 40 states allow same-sex marriage, "it is going to seem all right to tell Mississippi that it has to recognize gay marriage."\nJustice Antonin Scalia, a dissenter in 2003 and again this year, saw the seeds of same-sex marriage in the court\'s 2003 decision and he saw them again in the Windsor case, despite Kennedy\'s insistence that the opinion was limited.\n"How easy it is, indeed how inevitable, to reach the same conclusion with regard to state laws denying same-sex couples marital status," Scalia said.\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

Nothing “Duck Dynasty” patriarch Phil Robertson said . It might have been characteristically blunt, but Robertson neither singled out homosexuals nor questioned the humanity of gay people. Robertson focused on sexual including the sexual behavior of heterosexuals. The major media are merely using Robertson’s quotes to advance their own anti-Christian bigotry by smearing Christian beliefs as de facto bigotry and launching a McCarthyist campaign to silence Christians.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Worried they could be sued by gay couples, some churches are changing their bylaws to reflect their view that the Bible allows only marriage between one man and one woman.\nAlthough there have been suits against wedding industry businesses that refuse to serve gay couples, attorneys promoting the bylaw changes say they don\'t know of any lawsuits against churches.\nCritics say the changes are unnecessary, but some churches fear that it\'s only a matter of time before one of them is sued.\n"I thought marriage was always between one man and one woman, but the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision said no," said Gregory S. Erwin, an attorney for the Louisiana Baptist Convention, an association of Southern Baptist churches and one several groups advising churches to change their bylaws. "I think it\'s better to be prepared because the law is changing. America is changing."\nIn a June decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as between a man and a woman for purposes of federal law. A second decision was more technical but essentially ushered in legal gay marriage in California.\nKevin Snider is an attorney with the Pacific Justice Institute, a nonprofit legal defense group that specializes in conservative Christian issues. His organization released a model marriage policy a few years ago in response to a statewide gay marriage fight in California. Snider said some religious leaders have been threatened with lawsuits for declining to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies.\nDean Inserra, head pastor of the 1,000-member City Church Tallahassee, based in Florida, said he does not want to be alarmist, but his church is looking into how best to address the issue.\nInserra said he already has had to say no to gay friends who wanted him to perform a wedding ceremony.\n"We have some gay couples that attend our church. What happens when they ask us to do their wedding?" Inserra said. "What happens when we say no? Is it going to be treated like a civil rights thing?"\nCritics, including some gay Christian leaders, argue that the changes amount to a solution looking for a problem.\n"They seem to be under the impression that there is this huge movement with the goal of forcing them to perform ceremonies that violate their freedom of religion," said Justin Lee, executive director of the Gay Christian Network, a nonprofit that provides support for gay Christians and their friends and families and encourages churches to be more welcoming.\n"If anyone tried to force a church to perform a ceremony against their will, I would be the first person to stand up in that church\'s defense."\nThirteen states and the District of Columbia now recognize gay marriage.\nSome Christian denominations, such as the United Church of Christ and the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations, accept gay marriage. The Episcopal Church recently approved a blessing for same-sex couples, but each bishop must decide whether to allow the ceremony in his or her local diocese.\nThe majority of Christian denominations, however, view homosexual relationships as sinful. In more hierarchical denominations, like the Roman Catholic Church or the United Methodist Church, individual churches are bound by the policies of the larger denomination. But nondenominational churches and those loosely affiliated with more established groups often individually decide how to address social issues such as gay marriage.\nEric Rassbach is an attorney with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a public interest legal group that defends the free expression rights of all faiths. He said it is unlikely the government would try to force a pastor to perform a same-sex marriage, but churches that rent out their facilities to the general public could face problems if they refuse to rent to gay couples.\nAlthough his organization has not advocated it, he said it could strengthen a church\'s legal position to adopt a statement explaining its beliefs about marriage.\n"A number of groups don\'t have a written doctrine," Rassbach said. "Say a group like the Primitive Baptists -- they don\'t want a written-down credo, but the courts like written-down things."\nRassbach said it was important for churches to get their beliefs in writing before a dispute arises, otherwise it can look to a court as if something was done after the fact as an attempt to cover up hostility to gays.\nAirline Baptist Church Senior Pastor Chad Mills said members of the public use their facilities in is Bossier City, La., for many activities, including Zumba classes. In the past, anyone who could pay the fee was allowed to reserve the space. But recently, the church changed its rental policy to allow wedding-related events only for male-female couples.\nSome denominations are less concerned about the Supreme Court rulings. The Assemblies of God, the group of churches comprising the world\'s largest Pentecostal denomination, sought legal advice after the rulings. An attorney for the group distributed a memo to ministers saying there was no reason to change their bylaws.\nHowever, the memo also said that "doing so is not inappropriate, and may be warranted based on future rulings by the Supreme Court and other state and federal courts."\nThe bylaw changes are coming at a time when many churches are wrestling with gay marriage in general and are working hard to be more welcoming to gays and lesbians.\n"It\'s probably one of the most difficult issues our churches are facing right now," said Doug Anderson, a national coordinator with the evangelical Vineyard Church. "It\'s almost an impossible situation to reconcile what\'s going on in our culture, and our whole theology of welcoming and loving people, versus what it says in the Bible."

WASHINGTON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - More than 200 businesses will urge the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday to strike down a federal law that restricts the definition of marriage to heterosexual unions.\nLawyers representing the businesses said they would file a brief in the case.\nCompanies including Microsoft Corp, Google Inc , Starbucks Corp and Pfizer Inc are among those that joined the brief. Others included Aetna Inc , Amazon.com, Inc and Citigroup Inc.\nThomson Reuters Corp is another signatory. The Reuters news agency is part of Thomson Reuters.\nThe companies want the Supreme Court to strike down a key provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) that defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman.\nSeparately, lawyers representing another group of employers, including some of the same companies, had said already that they planned to file a brief on Thursday in a related case that questions a California law that bans gay marriage.\nThe two cases are to be argued before the Supreme Court on March 26 and 27.\nIn the brief filed on Wednesday, attorney Sabin Willett wrote that DOMA “requires that employers treat one employee differently from another, when each is married, and each marriage is equally lawful.”\nDOMA does not create any uniformity nationwide, Willett said, because 12 states in total either authorize same-sex marriage or recognize marriages that have been performed in other states.\nThat creates a burden for employers, particularly those who do business nationwide, he added.\nWillett also wrote that the law forces companies to discriminate, sometimes in contravention of their own internal policies and local laws, when dealing with healthcare plans and other benefits.\n“We must do all of this in states, counties and cities that prohibit workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and demand equal treatment of all married individuals,” he added.\nIn briefs already filed in support of marriage being restricted to heterosexual unions, business interests have not been represented. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has not taken a stand on the issue.

SALT LAKE CITY (RNS) — In the week since a federal judge overturned Utah’s ban on same-sex marriage, the number of weddings in the state has skyrocketed, shattering records and accruing thousands of dollars for Utah’s 29 counties.\nAs of close of business Thursday (Dec. 26), more than 1,225 marriage licenses had been issued in Utah since last Friday (Dec. 20). Of those, at least 74 percent, or 905 licenses, were issued to gay and lesbian couples.\nMarriage licenses in Utah cost between $30 and $50, depending on the county.\nWith an average marriage license costing $40, counties in Utah made a grand total of more than $49,000 in the three-and-a-half days most county clerk’s offices were open this week.\nAbout three-quarters of that money came from gay and lesbian couples seeking marriage licenses in the immediate aftermath of U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby’s ruling that overturned a statewide ban on same-sex marriages.\nSalt Lake County shattered a previously held record of 85 marriages in a given day, by handing out 353 on Monday (Dec. 23) — the first full day of issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\nOn the other hand, Piute, a small county of about 1,500 people in the center of the state, was of several counties with no takers. Had any Piute couples requested a license, they would have been denied anyway.\nCounty Clerk Valeen Brown is on vacation until Monday (Dec. 30), officials said. So, Piute officials suspended all marriage license activity until Brown returns.\nUtah County — which made national news this week when Shelly Eyre and her partner Cheryl Haws declared that they would sue its clerk for denying gay and lesbian couples — was doling out certificates Thursday to all.\n“Moving forward, we probably won’t keep track of how many same-sex couples versus opposite-sex couples we issue licenses to,” said Bryan Thompson, the county’s clerk and auditor. “I don’t see any reason to differentiate between them.”\n(Marissa Lang writes for The Salt Lake Tribune.)

CHICAGO (AP) — Twenty-five couples who filed a lawsuit challenging Illinois\' ban on gay marriage asked a judge on Wednesday to rule quickly in their favor, saying a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down part of a law denying federal benefits to married gay couples creates a new urgency in the state.\nIllinois legalized civil unions two years ago, but the recent Supreme Court decision applies only to married gay couples.\nLambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois filed a motion for summary judgment in Cook County Circuit Court. They said Judge Sophia Hall could rule on the motion as soon as Aug. 6, when oral arguments are scheduled on a defense motion to dismiss the lawsuit.\n"We will say that we should win as a matter of law" under the state constitution, said Camilla Taylor, Lambda Legal\'s marriage project director. "Illinois now is the only thing standing between these families and numerous federal rights."\nA lawyer representing five downstate county clerks — who are defending the ban after the state attorney general and Cook County prosecutor refused to do so — said the request is premature because all the evidence has not yet been presented. He also complained that the plaintiffs took nine months to respond to the motion to dismiss the case.\n"For them to come in (now) ... has me wondering if they\'re particularly confident of their legal position as a matter of law," said Peter Breen, executive director of the Thomas More Society, a public interest law firm that opposes gay marriage.\nWednesday\'s motion comes a day after civil rights lawyers in Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to overturn that state\'s 17-year-old ban on same-sex marriage and to force the state to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples who wed in other jurisdictions.\nSame-sex marriage is legal, or soon will be, in 13 states. Federal courts in California are so far the only ones that have said a state same-sex marriage ban violates the U.S. Constitution. Meanwhile, federal court challenges are emerging in other states, including Nevada, Hawaii and Michigan. In the coming days and weeks, the ACLU plans to lodge same-sex marriage challenges in North Carolina and Virginia.

Maryland state legislator Don Dwyer is a religious conservative who has called himself "the face of the opposition" to gay marriage, chastising fellow legislators to reject it because Jeebus and stuff. Most Americans, however, know this self-proclaimed defender of the Constitution and freedoms and whatnot mostly from his alcohol-fueled boating crash last year (and yes, there were injuries, and yes, he\'s still facing charges).\nIn this new, miserably depressing story on Dwyer, he cites two things as the reasons for the "increased" drinking that culminated in his crash with another boat, causing him multiple injuries and fracturing the skull of a five-year-old girl. The first is his 2011 separation from his wife. The second is the pressure of being in the legislature, but more specifically, that time other legislators "betrayed" him by not being sufficiently anti-gay-marriage themselves:\nDwyer says he felt sold out when Dels. Tiffany Alston, Wade Kach and Bob Costa voted for same-sex marriage, an issue he spent years crusading against. Dwyer told reporters one day before the vote that he had enough support to block the bill.\nKach, a Republican from Baltimore County, and Alston, a former Democrat from Prince George’s County, voted against the bill in committee. But Kach changed his vote after hearing testimony from gay couples. Alston shifted her vote after her amendment was adopted.\nKach and Costa, of Deale, were the only two House Republicans to vote for the bill. It passed the House by two votes in February.\n“I had no time to do anything,” Dwyer said. “Had I known earlier, I could have taken some action.”\nIt was petitioned to the November ballot and passed by 52 percent of voters state wide. Voters in Dwyer’s district, however, rejected it.\n“That betrayal really affected me,” he said. “I was physically ill. You pour your heart into an issue like that and it’s devastating.”\nHe said his drinking culminated in the crash.\nSo an intense hatred of gay marriage—and not having that hatred reciprocated by his fellow legislators and voters—is what drove this poor defender of proper marriage and proper faith to booze up and crash his damn boat into another boat. That\'s some powerful hatred, right there.\nIn the wake of the crash, Dwyer did not resign as any decent person might, instead gaudily announcing he needs to stay put to "defend individual liberty against unconstitutional laws," but he does admit he needs to rebuild "trust" with voters. I don\'t know that voters should be keen on reelecting someone whose past reaction to other people being insufficiently anti-gay was to booze up and nearly get some people killed, but I am not from Maryland, I am not a Republican voter, and Dwyer seems confident that all will be forgiven, allowing him to get back to expressing his obsessively anti-gay frustrations in some hopefully less child-skull-fracturing ways.\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is what it means to be an American religious conservative.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner on Monday opposed a bill to ban workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, dimming the chances of the White House-backed measure becoming law.\n“The speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost American jobs, especially small business jobs,” Boehner’s spokesman Michael Steel said in a statement.\nSteel issued the statement at about the same time that the bill’s backers in the Senate appeared to have gathered enough support to clear a Republican procedural roadblock.\nDean Heller of Nevada became the fifth Senate Republican to announce support for the bill. “This legislation raises the federal standards to match what we have come to expect in Nevada, which is that discrimination must not be tolerated under any circumstance,” Heller said.\nThe bill has become the latest example of the ideological struggle within the Republican party over gay rights. While an increasing number of Republicans are showing more flexibility over gay rights, conservative groups are threatening to mount challenges against those Republicans who support such measures.\nThe four other Senate Republicans who publicly back the bill are Orrin Hatch of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mark Kirk of Illinois.\nThese five Republicans, combined with all 53 Senate Democrats and two independents who routinely vote with them, will give supporters of the bill the 60 votes needed in the 100-member Senate to clear a Republican procedural roadblock.\nA vote was set for 5:30 p.m. (2230 GMT).\nBut before the Senate roll call could begin, it was upstaged by the statement from Boehner’s office and reaction to it.\nHouse passage had already seemed unlikely, but Boehner’s statement underscored the fact that there seems to be no interest from the Republican leadership in even bringing it up.\nRegardless, House Democrats said they would push to get a vote on the measure, guardedly hopeful that they could get most members of the chamber to support it.\nFred Sainz, a vice president of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest civil rights group for gays in the United States, ripped into Boehner, saying: “On a day when Senate Republicans are leading and saying ‘yes’ to employment protections, it doesn’t seem very smart for the speaker to say ‘no.’”\nPOLLS SHOW SUPPORT FOR GAY RIGHTS\n“He (Boehner) comes across as completely out of step with Americans,” said Sainz, alluding to polls showing that most Americans support gays rights.\nThe bill is seen as the most important gay-rights measure to come before Congress since the 2010 repeal of the U.S. military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy on gays in the armed forces.\nDemocrats and a number of Republicans have pushed for years for passage of such a bill. In 2007, the then Democratic-led House passed a smaller version of the latest measure, but Republicans in the Senate blocked it.\nThe current bill would prohibit employers from firing, refusing to hire, or discriminating against those employed or seeking employment, on the basis of their perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity.\nSuch protections are already prohibit discrimination based on race, religion, gender, national origin, age, and disability.\nNearly 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies now extend workplace protections based on sexual orientation and more than a third on the basis of gender identity, said supporters of the bill in the Senate.\nHeritage Action, a conservative advocacy group, opposes the bill and last week warned lawmakers that it would include their votes on it in their annual “legislative scorecard.”\nHeritage Action charges that the measure would undermine civil liberties, increase government interference in the labor market, and trample on religious liberty.\nAlthough the bill exempts religious groups, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops announced its opposition, in part, because of the measure’s support for gay marriage, which the Catholic Church opposes.\nHouse rejection of the bill would help shape mid-term congressional elections in November next year when a third of the 100-member Senate and the entire 435-member House will be up for grabs.\nThe gay community traditionally votes Democratic, and rejection of the bill would probably make it even more likely to maintain that support.\nAbout 5 percent of the voters in the 2012 election were lesbian, gay or bisexual and 76 percent of them voted for Democratic President Barack Obama, according to a poll commissioned by the Human Rights Campaign and conducted by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research.\nThe survey questioned 1,000 voters who participated in the 2012 election. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent.

The article examines a new book by Stephen Jimenez, The Book of Matt, which suggests Shepard’s murder was drug-related.\nIn Rios’ retelling, however, Shepard’s murder was part of a long-term plan by liberals and the LGBT community to create a society that is accepting of gay people.\nIt is up to Christian conservatives, Rios argued, to stop that acceptance. “We can’t let [gay people] keep breaking hearts and taking lives,” she said, one of a number of references Rios made to her theory that gay men are responsible for the AIDS epidemic.\n“You think youth is worshipped in heterosexual sex?

Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has endorsed same-sex marriage, becoming the third Republican senator to do so.\nIn a statement posted Wednesday on her website, Murkowski said supporting same-sex marriage is consistent with her values as a "lifelong Republican" who believes in "promoting freedom and limiting the reach of government."\n"I support the right of all Americans to marry the person they love and choose because I believe doing so promotes both values: it keeps politicians out of the most private and personal aspects of people\'s lives -- while also encouraging more families to form and more adults to make a lifetime commitment to one another," she said.\nMurkowski joins Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Mark Kirk of Illinois to voice support for the right of same-sex couples to marry.

FL-1064284 Comment collapsed by the community\nHere are some ways that the radical gay extremist liberal Democrat agenda would bring destruction to our nation:\n1. It would sanction fatherless and motherless households and condemn children to a single sex family with no female or male role model. This is proven to be destructive in a majority of studies. Actually this has not been proven.\n2. It would open the definition of marriage to all variances such a polygamy, incest marriages between same sex brothers or sisters. child / adult marriages, timed marriages and even bestiality. I am sure there would be other variants besides these. "Marriage" would become a free-for-all mess. Polygamy, incest and brother/sister marriages would all be "straight" marriages. You deal with that. We are talking about same sex marriages. Also in the countries that have allowed same sex marriage which ones have started what you list here?\n3. It will damage children - most gays are very unstable people. The gay divorce rate in recent studies is over 100 times the divorce rate of heterosexual divorces. This is the very definition of instability\nPlease list these so called studies. How can you have 100 times the divorce rate of 50% for straight couples. Please list this study as well.\n4. The radical gay extremist liberal Democrat world view of "morality" would be legally FORCED on everyone who does not agree with their morality. You would be forced to teach your children what they tell you to teach them - I repeat you would be FORCED to teach your children what gay dictators told you to teach them.\nYou have the choice of home schooling should you decide to raise your children under a rock. At some point your children will find out that some people are different. Are you going to wait until they are 18 to teach them about diversity?\n5. Christian pastors would be arrested for preaching the Bible - this is happening in Canada. So there would be no freedom of religion and no freedom of conscious for Christians (and Muslims for that matter). The radical gay liberal extremists would be able to dictate what pastors taught in their churches - you know like Hitler did after he put 4 million Christians in concentration camps.\nBelieve it or not we really do not care what you preach until it spills over into our lives. Preach what you want and believe what you want. We will do the same.\nYou are basing this statement on what?\n7. The laws we have in place for marriage benefits and worker benefits would undergo radical changes costing tax payers billions of dollars and increasing the national debt. Virtually any two people will be able to claim marriage benefits simply by claiming they are gay or bi-sexual which will produce catastrophic fraud with both business and government benefits. For example, two heterosexual male roommates could get “married” in order to claim partner benefits from the company that one of them worked at while maintaining relationships with girlfriends and just claim they are “bisexual.”\nAnother un-informed statement. You must present documentation to a company that you are living together when applying for same sex benefits. Fraud could occur but the same fraud could occur between a man and woman claiming to be "married" when they are dating other members of the same sex.\n8. Christian businesses and individuals will be sued if they stay true to God and their morals and do not support gay marriage. Eventually, courts may even put Christians in jail for not compromising their morals and their faith in God.\nMost state laws require you to serve everyone without exception. If this is a problem then do not open a business... Open a club.\n9. The homosexual extremists will you lawsuits and liberal judges to avoid a democrat vote of American people. Where they lose under a constitutional vote they will try to use judges who have no respect for the Constitution. This has already occurred in several states.\nNot sure what this means but I think you are saying a judge will overrule the vote of a majority? That is correct because you cannot vote on the rights of others. Sorry but that is la

Business\nBloomberg\n(Bloomberg) -- Who makes $100,000 a year? According to the U.S. government, air traffic controllers do. The academics who teach architects to design buildings that won’t collapse. And maybe soon, the guy who makes your Triple Layer Nachos some bleary midnight.Taco Bell’s announcement of a pilot program to raise manager pay to white-collar levels could presage a middle-class life for workers who have struggled in a winner-take-all economy. For Alex Torres, who grinds away as a $15.50-an-hour Taco Bell shift supervisor in Chicago, that salary -- roughly triple his current take -- could mean fulfilling a dream of seeing Rome.“If I had more money it would allow me to do a lot more,” he said Thursday before running to sprinkle two hard-shell tacos with lettuce and cheddar.The eye-catching move by the Yum! Brands Inc.-owned chain arrives amid a staffing crisis for all sorts of restaurants thanks to an unemployment rate at a 50-year low and after years of employers’ complaints that tight margins made higher wages impossible. Applebee’s, IHOP, Panda Express Inc. and Yard House all are paying up to find people to flip burgers, assemble salads and grill chicken. At Applebee’s restaurants in Woburn, Massachusetts, and Springfield, Oregon, a shortage of line cooks means they can earn $19 an hour.“It’s the tightest labor market I’ve seen in my career by a wide margin,” said Greg Flynn, founder of Flynn Restaurant Group, whose 460 stores make it the biggest Applebee’s franchisee. “We must and we do pay the wages that it takes to fill the positions that we need.”Critical CooksIHOP, owned by Dine Brands Global Inc. along with Applebee’s, and Darden Restaurants Inc.’s Yard House are offering hourly wages of $18 or more. Sit-down breakfast chain Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. has said finding labor is becoming a bigger challenge. Darden, which also owns Olive Garden and Yard House, doesn’t franchise, so those costs weigh directly on the company.Restaurants are hiking prices to compensate, but more expensive meat along with wage inflation is setting up the stiffest margin pressure in more than five years, according to Telsey Advisory Group. “The backdrop for 2020 food and labor inflation adds an ominous tone as the industry has already leaned on consumers in 2019 with some of its highest menu price inflation in years,” Telsey analyst Bob Derrington said.But without cooks and managers, there won’t be any business at all. Taco Bell now pays store bosses between $50,000 and $80,000. The $100,000 manager plan is meant to evaluate recruitment and retention in the Northeast and Midwest, Ferril Onyett, senior director of training and human resources, said in an email Friday. The company hasn’t decided how many outlets will participate, she said.Shares in Yum! have doubled in the past five years and now trade at about $102. Greg Creed, a company veteran who was chief executive officer for a half-decade before retiring Dec. 31, took home $38 million in 2018, the most recent year for which figures are disclosed.Nonetheless, Pedro Favela, 30, a Taco Bell manager in San Francisco, worried that the experiment might upset the balance between pay and employment.“There would probably be layoffs,” he said, explaining he didn’t think the restaurants could afford to pay more. Taco Bell offers phantasmagoric variations on Mexican food that appeal to a crowd that’s young, sometimes less than sober and occasionally digging for change. “We have items on the menu for $1,” Favela said.The risk may bring the reward of jobs that turn into careers. Indeed, the question of social mobility has been the driving force in the politics of 2020. Democratic presidential candidates have argued that the fruits of the record economic expansion, now in its 11th year, have flowed mainly to the wealthy. Unemployment is at 3.5%, according to figures released Friday, yet wage gains are tepid. Average hourly wage growth is running at a year-over-year pace of 2.9%, the slowest since mid-2018.The average American brought home $51,960 in 2018, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but food preparation and serving jobs are among the lowest paid, with a median wage of $21,350. That’s about half of what carpenters, truckers and vocational nurses earn and about $4,000 less than taxi drivers and chauffeurs.But demand for cooks is expected to far outpace general job growth, mostly because of population and income growth that will result in more takeout, delivery and eating out, the bureau says. The situation is particularly dire for restaurants that need cooks. In Renton and Auburn, Washington, IHOP restaurants are paying $18 an hour for those with experience. Yard House is offering as much as $20 an hour for a location opening in February in Burlington, Massachusetts.Panda Express, which built the largest Chinese-restaurant empire in the U.S. over the past three decades, increased average hourly wages 17% since 2017. The closely held company run by Peggy and Andrew Cherng, is offering some employees sweeteners like stock options and a 401(k) contribution match, as well as financial assistance for continuing education.“It’s hard across the board to get people, but definitely a little more difficult to get cooks,” said Wesley Janssen of Dickie Brennan, which owns five sit-down restaurants in New Orleans, along with a catering division. The company, which employs 600, recently decreased weekly hours required from 37 to 32 for staff to earn benefits including money toward buying a home. It also recently raised starting pay for its cooks to roughly $12 an hour -- equivalent to only about $25,000 a year.Hardship Duty“The wage rates have gone up but it’s been pretty low paid,” said Bob Goldin, partner at food-service consultant Pentallect. “You’re cutting, slicing, dicing, working over a hot stove, getting there early. Being a cook is really hard.”Being a restaurant manager is no treat, either. Jethron Ravilla runs one of the many joint Taco Bell-KFC franchises in San Francisco that are owned by Harman Management Corp.On Thursday, there was a line nearly out the door of about a dozen people waiting to order. With no one else equipped to run the register, Ravilla slowly whittled down the backlog of customers, including a man with his pants around his knees sipping from a small bottle of liquor. Ravilla took everyone’s order with enthusiasm and patience, all while making sure the three employees in the back were preparing the orders correctly and telling someone at the back of the line, yes they do accept government benefit cards.And the labor shortage brings managers still another duty. At Favela’s Taco Bell in San Francisco, he had to excuse himself from a reporter to address a man who had been sitting at another table:“Sorry to keep you waiting. You’re here to interview for a job, right?”\\--With assistance from Reade Pickert, Alex Tanzi, Anders Melin and Matthew Boyle.To contact the reporters on this story: Leslie Patton in Chicago at lpatton5@bloomberg.net;Sophie Alexander in New York at salexander82@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sally Bakewell at sbakewell1@bloomberg.net, Stephen Merelman, Peter EichenbaumFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.

More\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wineries are coming out loud and proud in their support of gay marriage. They\'re putting it right on the label.\n"Little by little, we\'re breaking down the barrier," says Gary Saperstein of Out in the Vineyard, an events and tour company based in Sonoma wine country that caters to gay travelers.\nOne of the barrier-breakers is Same Sex Meritage, a red blend that sends its message on the bottle and at the cash register — $1 for every bottle sold is donated to the advocacy group Freedom to Marry.\n"It\'s the right thing to do," says Matt Gold, who is based in Chicago and teamed with Josh Stein of Stein Family Wines in California to make the wine, which launched last December. Meritage is a brand name that refers to a Bordeaux-style blend. And, of course, it sounds a lot like marriage.\nGold and Stein see their business partnership as a way to make wine and make a statement. "Everyone should have the right to marry. Everyone should have the same rights as anyone else," says Gold.\nSame Sex Meritage isn\'t the only wine reaching out to the LGBT community.\nEgalite, a bubbly from the Burgundy region of France, was launched earlier this year with the name — French for equality — reflecting the wine\'s origins as a Burgundy cremant (sparkling wine) and its support for the gay community. Each quarter, a portion of profits is donated to a LGBT nonprofit organization chosen by fans of the wine on Facebook; $15,000 has been donated since the wine\'s January launch.\nFrom Stand Tall Wines, there\'s Genetic Pinot Noir, which refers to sexual orientation having genetic origins. Stand Tall Wines was founded by Larisa Stephenson and partner Dana Sabin. The wine is being made in the Napa Valley using grapes shipped from Oregon\'s Willamette Valley and 1 percent of Genetic sales is being donated to the Napa LBGTQ Project (which is the process of changing its name to LGBTQ Connection).\nAnd though it doesn\'t have a message-specific label, Barefoot Wine & Bubbly has been supporting marriage rights for gays for 25 years, donating to local LGBT centers and other organizations, investing in Pride Week events, even putting up a 20-foot-tall inflatable wedding cake in front of San Francisco\'s City Hall to show support for gay marriage.\n"We definitely love to celebrate the LGBT community and all of its progress," says Jerime Black, Barefoot\'s national LGBT sales and marketing manager. "Barefoot really is all about fun. It\'s taking the stuffiness out of wine."\nOK, so not too many major wine companies have an LGBT marketing manager. So far as he knows, Black is the only one of his kind. "I like to say I have the gay man\'s dream job," he jokes. But there has been a growing awareness of the importance of that community.\nAlong with the philosophical statements, the marketing effort makes good economic sense. Saperstein credits some of the awareness of LGBT consumers to the economic crisis. With consumers cutting back on luxury purchases, producers started studying the market, looking for niches.\nOut in the Vineyard sponsors a Gay Wine Weekend each June and this year had more than 30 wineries involved at various levels of participation.\nFor Sonoma and Napa Valley producers, the LGBT market is a particularly good fit since the wine regions are close to San Francisco and its substantial gay population which, Saperstein points out, includes a lot of people who love food and wine.\nAs with all marketing, it\'s important to back up the message with a real commitment. "Don\'t think it\'s a one-time hit and you\'re going to get a payback right away. You have to show the community that you care," says Saperstein.\nGold\'s aware that message-specific wines are in danger of being dismissed as a gimmick, which is why he and Stein work to make sure the wine in the bottle lives up to the label.\n"We have to have a good quality wine," he says. "Otherwise people are only going to buy it once."\n___\nhttp://samesexmeritage.com/

A Colorado judge says a baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex ceremony must serve gay couples despite his religious beliefs, a ruling that a civil rights group hailed as a victory for gay rights.\nAdministrative Law Judge Robert N. Spencer ruled Friday that Jack Phillips, the owner of the Masterpiece Cakeshop in suburban Denver, will face fines if he continues to turn away gay couples who want to buy wedding cakes.\n“The undisputed facts show that Respondents (Phillips) discriminated against Complainants because of their sexual orientation by refusing to sell them a wedding cake for their same-sex marriage,” Spencer wrote.\nLast year, David Mullins and Charlie Craig visited the Masterpiece Cakeshop to order a cake for their upcoming wedding reception. The couple had planned to marry in Massachusetts and hold a reception in Colorado.\nPhillips told the men that he could not bake their cake because of his religious beliefs opposing same-sex marriage. He offered to make them any other baked item, but not a wedding cake. The couple immediately left the shop and later filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Division.\n“Being denied service by Masterpiece Cakeshop was offensive and dehumanizing especially in the midst of arranging what should be a joyful family celebration,” Mullins said in a statement. “No one should fear being turned away from a public business because of who they are.”\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado hailed the ruling and said it serves as a warning.\n“While we all agree that religious freedom is important, no one’s religious beliefs make it acceptable to break the law by discriminating against prospective customers,” ACLU staff attorney Amanda Goad said in a statement. “No one is asking Masterpiece’s owners to change his beliefs, but treating gay people differently because of who they are is discrimination plain and simple.”\nPhillips was represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal firm specializing in religious liberty cases. Attorney Nicolle Martin condemned the judge’s ruling.\n“America was founded on the fundamental freedom of every citizen to live and work according to their beliefs,” Martin said in a prepared statement. “Forcing Americans to promote ideas against their will undermines our constitutionally protected freedom of expression and our right to live free.”\nMartin said this was simply a case of a baker who declined to use his personal creative abilities to promote and endorse a same-sex ceremony.\n“If the government can take aware our First Amendment freedoms, there is nothing it can’t take away,” she said.\nMartin added that Phillips is a devoted Christian who has an unwavering faith. She said he is a person of such deep faith that he won’t even bake Halloween-themed treats – at all.\n“He’s just trying to live within a certain set of biblical principals because he believes that he answers to God for everything that he does,” Martin told Fox News.\nShe said this case is an example of gay rights trumping religious rights.\n“It sends a message not just to other business owners, it sends a message to Americans – that if the government can take away our First amendment freedoms and tell you what to say and when to say it, there’s nothing they can’t take away,” Martin told Fox News.\nJudge Spencer said Phillips did not demonstrate that his free speech rights had been violated and he said there’s no evidence that forcing him to make a cake for a same-sex ceremony would hurt his business.\n“On the contrary, to the extent that the law prohibits Respondents’ (Phillips) from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, compliance with the law would likely increase their business by not alienating the gay community,” he wrote.\nMartin said it was unclear if Phillips will appeal the judge’s ruling.

In that op-ed, are you implying in your argument against lifting the ban that homosexuality is synonymous with pedophilia? <p><strong>Whelan:</strong> Not at all. In fact, I think the example I give indicates exactly the opposite. Look, what\'s at issue here is that we have an organization that has long stood in defense of traditional, American, moral values, and it\'s attracted supporters and parents from churches precisely because it has stood in defense of those values. The Supreme Court has held that the Boy Scouts have a First Amendment constitutional right to pursue their values and to exclude leaders whose presence would be inconsistent with those values. That includes, by the way, not just gays, but atheists. Now, we can respect, and we do respect, our fellow citizens who are gays or atheists. We love our relatives or friends who are gays or atheists. But we are not obligated to regard them as suitable to be Scout leaders.</p> <p><strong>Host:</strong> Hm. All right, well let me ask Zach to weigh in here. Zach?</p> <p><strong>Wahls:</strong> Yeah, I think it\'s interesting that Ed is going to this, you know, traditional, moral values framework. I think what he is trying to do is define this as some particular biblical, literal, fundamentalist tradition that has become popular in the U.S. over the last forty years. The reality is that there are Christians of all different denominations who are applauding the BSA for this proposed policy change, including the United Church of Christ, one of the BSA\'s top eight church sponsors, which on Friday issued a statement saying, &quot;The ban is inconsistent with the values of dignity and respect which serve as the foundation of the Scouting program,&quot; and we couldn\'t agree more. Even though Ed may be talking about respect, respect for him is a one-way street. Nobody is calling for the exclusion of Baptists or Mormons or Catholics or, frankly, anybody who even holds Ed\'s point of view. What we\'re trying to say is that Scouts should be an inclusive program experiencing, you know, a large amount of inclusivity because we believe in the values that constitute the program.</p> <p><strong>Host:</strong> Let me ask you about this woman, Ed--Jennifer Tyrell. She was kicked out of the Scouts. She is a lesbian mom who was a den leader for her son. Is she a threat?</p> <p><strong>Whelan:</strong> Look, the question here is whether a private organization can have its own standards for for its leaders.</p> <p><strong>Host:</strong> But answer that question first, if you will. Is she a threat?</p> <p><strong>Whelan:</strong> I don\'t know this particular woman. How could I possibly judge whether she\'s a threat? The fact of the matter is that organizations have all sorts of general rules that they adopt because the rules are sensible, and we don\'t have to defend every single application of every particular rule. The problem here is that the Boy Scouts, if they adopt this notion that different troops can have different policies, it\'s completely unworkable, it\'s going to invite legal attacks on the troops that maintain the traditional policies, and Zach and his cohorts are not going to call a peace truce. They\'re going to realize that the Boy Scouts can be intimidated, and they\'re going to continue to intimidate them, and this is an unstable stopping point--it\'s just a path to further surrender.</p> <p><strong>Wahls:</strong> Speaking as an Eagle Scout and somebody who actually spent twelve years in the organization, I simply have to disagree. We\'re appealing to the traditional values that have been a part of the Boy Scouts from their very inception in 1903, and I feel that, moving forward, this is going to be a part of the program that is fostering inclusiveness, and applying the values and the lifelong principles of the Boy Scouts to the entire, you know, population of young American men, not just those who happen to be straight. And further, on your point of whether or not this is something that is an unworkable legal solution, on a national call with the key three of the Boy Scouts earlier this week, the president of the board said, &quot;With the current ban in place, we don\'t want to find ourselves in a position in which a judge is telling us that we need to expand our policy even further than we\'re going here.&quot; So even though you might be, you know, looking at this in one specific way, the BSA certainly isn\'t taking that position at all.</p> <p><strong>Host:</strong> Ed, let me ask you, because I know you mentioned this change in policy would deprive the troops of protection. Protection from what? What do they need protection from?</p> <p><strong>Whelan:</strong> They need protection from legal challenges to their decision to exclude gay leaders. The national Supreme Court organization won that victory thirteen years ago. They\'re throwing it away in a way that would expose local troops and volunteer leaders to lawsuits by activists like Zach.</p> <p><strong>Host:</strong> Would you want your son to be in the Scouts if he was gay?</p> <p><strong>Whelan:</strong> [long pause] Uh, I think a question like that directed at my son is a rude question, but let me answer it this way. I would not have put my son in a troop with an openly gay leader or an openly atheist leader. And lots and lots of other parents, the most vibrant part of the Boy Scouts, feel the same. So Zach can cite, you know, one liberal denomination that is satisfied with this proposal. There are plenty of other folks who aren\'t, and I think the Boy Scouts--</p> <p><strong>Wahls:</strong> That\'s an interesting point--</p> <p><strong>Whelan:</strong> Please let me finish. This, I think, would be an epic failure in leadership if they were to cave to the financial pressure that Zach and others are putting on them. This isn\'t a decision being made on the merits--this is a decision that is being made in the face of financial pressure, the almighty buck, and what sort of lesson is it to Scouts that the national organization would cave because of financial pressure rather than adhere to principle?</p> <p><strong>Host:</strong> Let me let Zach jump in here with the final word.</p> <p><strong>Wahls:</strong> I mean, yeah, to be clear, it\'s not just the UCC that has weighed in. Currently, the Mormon Church and Catholic Church, hardly denominations known for their liberal stances, have both declined to comment. Only the Baptists--</p> <p><strong>Whelan:</strong> [angrily] They\'re not going to approve this! Don\'t you dare suggest they\'re going to approve this!</p> <p><strong>Host:</strong> Ed, let Zach finish.</p> <p><strong>Wahls:</strong> No, I mean, the point is simply that, while there may be some who are, you know, very opposed to this policy position, there is a vast difference between being opposed to gay marriage and opposing the enrichment and development of young men because they happen to be not straight. So while I think Ed\'s position is, you know, certainly one that I will respect, and we\'re not going to remove his son from the program, I think he should understanding that Scouts is about respecting the opinions of all the people who want to be members, not just some.</p> <p><strong>Whelan:</strong> You\'re not respecting it, you\'re trying to--</p> <p><strong>Host:</strong> Appreciate your time. Appreciate both of you discussing this this morning. Thank you.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, Ed, time to shut up.</p>\n<p>I\'ll say it again: I love Zach Wahls. I think our ol\' pal Ed realizes he\'s on the losing side of this, and he\'s losing a good amount of sweat over this. Even if the BSA doesn\'t change its policy this time around, the time is coming, and probably very soon. Be scared, Ed. Be scared.</p>', 'text': 'Oh man.

Enter whose Wednesday show featured a fascinating exchange with Terry Jeffrey, a news editor from News Service, and Rev. Oliver White, a pro-same sex marriage pastor. Because is not constrained by the limitations of a TV news schedule and the need to change subjects every 5 minutes, as is so often the case on cable news, he was able to allow the on-air debate over the scriptural basis for marriage to naturally unfold to the point where the lack of scriptural foundation for same-sex marriage was laughingly evident.

Departing Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta extended Monday a list of benefits — all previously denied by the Pentagon — to the same-sex spouses of service members as well as to the unmarried partners of gay troops.\nThe perks, automatically available to heterosexual military spouses, will include child care services, member-designated hospital visits, and the issuing of military ID cards, which will give same-sex spouses and partners access to on-base commissaries, movie theaters and gyms. The policy changes will go into effect once training on the new rules is completed, Panetta said.\nWhile advocates for gay and lesbian service members and their families hailed Panetta’s policy switch as “substantive” and “encouraging,” the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) still blocks the DOD from enacting more than 85 other benefits now provided to heterosexual military spouses and their children — most notably medical and dental care, housing allowances, and death benefits.\nAlso, as NBC News reported Feb. 4, that same federal law mandates that when a gay service member is killed in combat, military officials must first notify that troop’s blood family, not their spouse, as is normally the course of action.\nPanetta said DOMA is “now being reviewed by the United States Supreme Court" — and he offered his first clear signal that the Pentagon wants that law overturned.\n“There are certain benefits that can only be provided to spouses as defined by that law,” Panetta said. “While it will not change during my tenure as secretary of defense, I foresee a time when the law will allow the department to grant full benefits to service members and their dependents, irrespective of sexual orientation. Until then, the department will continue to comply with current law while doing all we can to take care of all soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and their families."\nSame-sex advocates have been pushing the DOD to extend full benefits to the spouses and partners of all U.S. service members since the repeal 17 months of ago of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy which prohibited gay troops from revealing their sexual orientation.\n“At the time of repeal, I committed to reviewing benefits that had not previously been available to same-sex partners based on existing law and policy,” Panetta said. “It is a matter of fundamental equity that we provide similar benefits to all of those men and women in uniform who serve their country ...\n“Taking care of our service members and honoring the sacrifices of all military families are two core values of this nation. Extending these benefits is an appropriate next step under current law to ensure that all service members receive equal support for what they do to protect this nation."\nAdvocates for gay and lesbian service members and their families praised Panetta’s policy shift although they said that the move is not groundbreaking due to the DOMA legal blockade.\n“Secretary Panetta’s decision today answers the call President (Barack) Obama issued in his inaugural address to complete our nation\'s journey toward equality, acknowledging the equal service and equal sacrifice of our gay and lesbian service members and their families,” said Allyson Robinson, an Army veteran and executive director of OutServe-SLDN, an association of actively serving lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender U.S. military personnel with more than 50 chapters and 6,000 members.\n“We thank him for getting us a few steps closer to full equality — steps that will substantively improve the quality of life of gay and lesbian military families,” Robinson said.\nThe American Military Partner Association (AMPA), a support network for LGBT military families, released the following statement today in response to Panetta\'s announcement:\n“We’ve waited far too long for this, and it’s fantastic news that our dedicated military families will now have access to some of the benefits and support services they need and deserve,” said Stephen Peters, the group\'s president. “However, (DOMA) continues to undermine our military families who sacrifice so much for our nation. This summer, we hope that the Supreme Court will make it clear that our families are just as important and deserve the same protections, benefits, and support that federal recognition brings.”\nTo offer the new benefits to partners, DOD will ask gay and lesbian service members to sign a “Declaration of Domestic Partnership” in which they will attest that they are in a committed relationship, and intend to remain so indefinitely, and that neither is legally married, according to OutServe-SLDN.\nThe changes will take “several months to complete, Pentagon officials said. The extra time is needed so that military leaders can offer a chance for the public to comment on the new rules and also to allow an opportunity for each of the branches to update its IT system, develop new processes for issuing ID cards, and train their personnel on the refreshed benefits package.\nPanetta did stop short on offering a full slate of benefits that gay advocates have been requesting for two years: on-base housing and burial at Arlington National Cemetery and other items that don’t fall under DOMA, according to OutServe-SLDN. (The organization’s lawyers drafted an explanation outlining the policy shift for gay service members and their families.)\nDOD officials have explained to OutServe-SLDN that “policy for burial at Arlington National Cemetery is under review. At issue is how to verify eligible same-sex relationships for the surviving spouse in order to ensure equitable policy implementation."\nNBC News\' Jim Miklaszewski contributed to this report.\nRelate

SANTA FE, New Mexico (Reuters) - The New Mexico Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Thursday to allow same-sex marriage statewide, ending a patchwork arrangement in which some counties permitted gay nuptials while others prohibited them.\nThe ruling makes New Mexico the 17th U.S. state to legalize gay and lesbian marriage, and comes after the governors of Hawaii and Illinois signed bills last month to permit same-sex weddings in their states.\n“Denying same-gender couples the right to marry and thus depriving them and their families of the rights, protections and responsibilities of civil marriage violates the equality demanded by the equal protection clause of the New Mexico Constitution,” Justice Edward Chavez wrote in a 31-page opinion.\nThe ruling found that civil marriage should be “construed to mean the voluntary union of two persons to the exclusion of all others” and that “all rights, protections and responsibilities that result from marital relationship shall apply equally.”\nThe decision highlights the shifting legal and social landscape on gay marriage in the United States. Polls have shown increasing public support, and civil rights groups have prevailed at a number of courthouses and with an increasing number of state legislatures. Ten years ago, no U.S. states permitted gay marriage.\nStepping into an intensifying and often bitter national debate over same-sex matrimony, the New Mexico Supreme Court agreed in September to settle the matter for the state after some counties began issuing marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples, either unilaterally or in response to lower-court rulings.\nIn a previous ruling, a New Mexico judge upheld the right to gay marriage in a case that applied to counties encompassing the state’s largest city, Albuquerque, and the state capital of Santa Fe.\nLater, judges in a number of other counties asked clerks to justify their practice of not issuing same-sex marriage licenses. Many clerks began issuing such licenses to same-sex couples rather than go back to court.\nNEW PUSH FOR AMENDMENT?\nOne of New Mexico’s most vocal opponents of same-sex marriage, Republican state Senator Bill Sharer, responded to the ruling by saying he planned to introduce a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Such an amendment, if passed by the legislature, would ultimately need approval of voters.\n“The Supreme Court decided to overturn a several-millennial-long standing law, and I don’t think they had any good reason to do it,” Sharer said.\nBrian Brown, president of the anti-gay marriage group the National Organization for Marriage, called the ruling “a continuation of a very dangerous rush” toward silencing those who see marriage as the union of one man and one woman.\nIn celebratory tweets, supporters of gay marriage planned Thursday night rallies in several cities. Among those welcoming the ruling was graphic designer Alex Hanna, 43, who along with his partner of 14 years, Yon Hudson, was a plaintiff in a separate legal case seeking a marriage license in Santa Fe.\n“We haven’t announced our wedding because we wanted it to be legal in the whole state. That was our goal,” Hanna said.\nBefore the ruling, New Mexico faced a situation unique in the United States because its law was ambiguous on same-sex marriage, unlike other states that expressly prohibited or permitted it via constitutional amendments or state law.\nThe debate reached a crescendo when all 33 county clerks in the state joined the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Center for Lesbian Rights in petitioning New Mexico’s high court to decide the issue on a statewide basis.\nEight New Mexico counties were processing marriage applications by same-sex couples ahead of the ruling, said ACLU of New Mexico spokesman Micah McCoy.\n“This truly is a historic and joyful day for New Mexico,” said Laura Schauer Ives, legal adviser for the ACLU of New Mexico. “The more than 1,000 same-sex couples who have already married in New Mexico can now rest certain knowing their marriages will be recognized and respected by our state.”\nThe ruling goes into effect immediately, said Phil Sisneros, spokesman for state Attorney General Gary King, a Democrat, and lawyers from the plaintiffs’ legal team.\n“The attorney general is very pleased with the court’s ruling and feels that it’s something that a great deal of New Mexicans have been waiting for,” Sisneros said.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — For Mina Meyer and Sharon Raphael, two women in their 70s who fell in love more than four decades ago and have been married for more than four years, the U.S. Supreme Court\'s pending consideration of a law that prohibits the federal government from recognizing unions like theirs is about more than civil rights. It\'s about buying a new roof for their California home, replacing their 2005 Toyota Camry, and ensuring Meyer doesn\'t take a financial hit if Raphael dies first.\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral arguments this month in a challenge to a provision of the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, that denies legally married gay and lesbian couples federal benefits available to heterosexual married couples, including tax and Social Security benefits. A decision is not expected until the end of June, but accountants and tax attorneys anticipating the 18-year-old law\'s demise are already encouraging same-sex couples like Raphael and Meyer to seek prospective tax refunds, back retirement payments and other spousal subsidies they may have been denied.\nIt is unclear how the justices might rule, but the Obama administration and former President Bill Clinton, who signed the act into law, have urged the court to overturn it on grounds that it violates the civil rights of gay Americans. DOMA supporters, including House Republicans led by Speaker John Boehner, argue that Congress — not the court — should decide as public opinion for same-sex marriage grows. Other conservative groups argue that spousal benefits should be reserved only for couples of the opposite sex.\nPart of the urgency for couples to act stems from deadlines established under the U.S. tax code, which gives taxpayers three years to file protective claims for income and estate tax refunds. Same-sex couples or surviving spouses who were legally married before or during 2009 would therefore have until April 15 of this year to submit amended returns claiming overpayments on income for that tax year, said Vickie Henry, a senior staff attorney at Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders.\nAt the time, gay unions were legal in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa and Vermont, and briefly had been in California. New York and the District of Columbia, which have since legalized same-sex unions, also recognized marriages performed in other states or countries.\nWhile married couples from those jurisdictions would have the strongest cases, couples from states such as Hawaii, Nevada and Illinois that treat domestic partnerships and civil unions as the same as marriage for tax purposes might also see federal refunds depending on how the Supreme Court rules, said Pat Cain, a federal tax expert at the Santa Clara University School of Law.\n"On the income tax side, anybody who would benefit from filing jointly and who would be eligible to do so if DOMA falls should consider filing amended tax returns for the applicable years," Cain said.\nThe sums at stake are not inconsequential. The case the justices accepted, for example, involves a New York state widow, Edith Windsor, 83, who is seeking a refund of the $363,000 she had to pay in estate taxes after her wife, Thea Spyer, died in 2009. If Windsor had not been married to another woman, her tax bill would have been $0 because married U.S. citizens are allowed to pass their assets onto their spouses tax-free — but only if the surviving spouse is of the opposite sex.\nGerald McIntyre, directing attorney at the National Senior Citizens Law Center, said Social Security benefits, which kick in based on the date of application, are where gay couples have lost the most and stand the most to gain.\nLower-earning spouses such as Meyer have been doubly penalized under DOMA, McIntrye said, first by being unable to claim the spousal benefit that allows married heterosexuals to increase their monthly benefits by drawing half of a husband or wife\'s Social Security, then being deemed ineligible for survivor benefits that are equal to what a deceased spouse got in retirement each month.\nA 2009 study by The Williams Institute, a think tank on sexual orientation and the law at the University of California, Los Angeles, estimated that gay couples received an average of $3,060 less a year in Social Security benefits than married straight couples. For lesbian couples, the disparity rose to $5,412. The same study found that gay or lesbian widows or widowers lost out on more than $5,700 a year in survivor benefits than their straight counterparts received.\nIn the case of retirees Raphael and Meyer, it could mean an additional $7,335 year in Social Security benefits because Meyer, who worked in office jobs and a bookstore, would be entitled to the Social Security benefits of Raphael, who earned considerably more as a college professor for 40 years. That would boost their fixed monthly income by about 10 percent. Last year, on the advice of a professional colleague and with the high court poised to decide if DOMA is constitutional, Meyer applied for more than a year\'s worth of retroactive benefits as well as bigger future checks if the law is struck down.\n"This is not the only money we live on, but it does make a big difference," said Meyer, 73, who also would see her Social Security checks more than quadruple in the event she is widowed and the court overturns the act. "That $700 a month is $700 a month."\nOther married same-sex couples may end up paying more in taxes if DOMA is overturned, due to the so-called federal "marriage penalty." Janis Cowhey McDonagh, a tax attorney in the New York office of accounting firm Marcum LLP, (equals) has been encouraging many of her clients in same-sex marriages to get their returns in order before the Supreme Court rules.\n"If it\'s better for them to file single even though they are married, I tell them they need to file before DOMA comes down, because if DOMA comes down, they won\'t have the choice," she said.\n___

The Criss clan had just moved to the area, and there was concern that Criss\' younger sister, Beth, wouldn\'t know anyone at school.</p>\n<p>Family friends hatched a plan. Sproles would go meet Beth and befriend her, ensuring she didn\'t start the new academic year at the local school without any friends.</p>\n<p>&quot;She knocks on the door and my sister and I &ndash; both shy girls &ndash; answer the door where she says, \'Hi I\'m Cheryl Sproles. I\'m the most popular girl in town, and I\'m here to be your friend,\' &quot; said Criss.</p>\n<p>There were no fireworks, no pledges of undying love, no Pavarotti playing in the background.

I was living in New York. I knew it was a lifestyle or something, (but) being raised in the Baptist Church, it was not a possibility.</p>\n<p>&quot;When I moved to New York and was introduced to different faiths and different people, it was just kind of eye-opening,&quot; Sproles said. &quot;I don\'t want to make it sound like New York made me realize I was gay, but I had an intern and she said she had a crush on me and I had all these feelings happen.&quot;</p>\n<p>Nearly six years ago, Criss was at her job with the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal in Tupelo, a job she still holds.</p>\n<p>Sproles had suffered a stroke a year before that, eventually selling her business in Jackson and starting her recovery. One day, while driving through Tupelo, Sproles said she looked up her old friend.</p>\n<p>&quot;I asked her out to lunch,&quot; Sproles said. &quot;And we\'ve been together pretty much ever since.&quot;</p>\n<p>Sproles moved to Tupelo. About a year later, the couple held a commitment ceremony.</p>\n<p>It was an experience Criss thought she\'d never have.</p>\n<p>But there they were, surrounded by family in a small ceremony that announced their intentions to live life to the fullest with each other.</p>\n<p>&quot;I have never laughed as much as I have the last six years,&quot; Criss said. &quot;We\'ve had some sad times, too.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Yeah, we have,&quot; Sproles said.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, the self-diagnosed shy Criss has an infectious grin on her face. The woman who had been content sitting in the audience stood on a theater stage during a recent production of &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird,&quot; an idea encouraged by her theatrical partner.</p>\n<p>And Sproles, a woman who has a million faces and hilarious quips, pauses from time to time to stare lovingly at the woman who anchors her life while keeping her free spirit intact.</p>\n<p>It\'s the work of each woman, wives in everything but name only.</p>\n<p><strong>Amelie &amp; Sabrina: A proud family</strong></p>\n<p>North Mississippi can be described as one of the most conservative areas in one of the most conservative states.

Mississippi &mdash; Houston, specifically &mdash; is where the couple held a commitment ceremony.</p>\n<p>&quot;She walked in and she wouldn\'t give me the time of day,&quot; said Hahn of the couple\'s first encounter. &quot;I tried to talk to her, and she wouldn\'t speak to me, pay me any attention at all.&quot;</p>\n<p>At their first meeting, Hahn made paper footballs, flipping them in Mays\' direction.

At least in some part of Mississippi.</p>\n<p>&quot;We\'re comfortable here,&quot; said Hahn, adding she and her family want to move to Jackson, a place she describes as being more open than Houston and closer to the hospital where they take Haley, a special needs child.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the family will continue to make an example of themselves, a testament to their normalcy.</p>\n<p>&quot;What we\'re going to have to do is make our presence known and get people to see us as human beings because that\'s what we are, you know, we\'re a family just like any other family,&quot; Hahn said. &quot;We get up in the morning, we eat breakfast, the kids go to school, she goes to work, I start my school work.&quot;</p>\n<p>And Hahn said her family is the reason she will stay and take a stand.</p>\n<p>&quot;If we leave, then that\'s one less couple to stand up and speak out.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Eddie &amp; Justin: A living example</strong></p>\n<p>Growing up gay in the South isn\'t easy for many members of the LGBT community, but the times, they are changing.</p>\n<p>Eddie Outlaw and Justin McPherson have carved out their own little piece of Jackson, the city where they have lived the last nine years.

I knew it was a lifestyle or something, (but) being raised in the Baptist Church, it was not a possibility.\n"When I moved to New York and was introduced to different faiths and different people, it was just kind of eye-opening," Sproles said. "I don\'t want to make it sound like New York made me realize I was gay, but I had an intern and she said she had a crush on me and I had all these feelings happen."\nNearly six years ago, Criss was at her job with the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal in Tupelo, a job she still holds.\nSproles had suffered a stroke a year before that, eventually selling her business in Jackson and starting her recovery. One day, while driving through Tupelo, Sproles said she looked up her old friend.\n"I asked her out to lunch," Sproles said. "And we\'ve been together pretty much ever since."\nSproles moved to Tupelo. About a year later, the couple held a commitment ceremony.\nIt was an experience Criss thought she\'d never have.\nBut there they were, surrounded by family in a small ceremony that announced their intentions to live life to the fullest with each other.\n"I have never laughed as much as I have the last six years," Criss said. "We\'ve had some sad times, too."\n"Yeah, we have," Sproles said.\nNowadays, the self-diagnosed shy Criss has an infectious grin on her face. The woman who had been content sitting in the audience stood on a theater stage during a recent production of "To Kill A Mockingbird," an idea encouraged by her theatrical partner.\nAnd Sproles, a woman who has a million faces and hilarious quips, pauses from time to time to stare lovingly at the woman who anchors her life while keeping her free spirit intact.\nIt\'s the work of each woman, wives in everything but name only.\nAmelie & Sabrina: A proud family\nNorth Mississippi can be described as one of the most conservative areas in one of the most conservative states. But for Amelie Hahn and Sabrina Mays, it\'s home.\nIt\'s where the two met three years ago while working for the U.S. Census Bureau\'s big count. Mississippi — Houston, specifically — is where the couple held a commitment ceremony.\n"She walked in and she wouldn\'t give me the time of day," said Hahn of the couple\'s first encounter. "I tried to talk to her, and she wouldn\'t speak to me, pay me any attention at all."\nAt their first meeting, Hahn made paper footballs, flipping them in Mays\' direction. It was a schoolyard attempt to get a crush to look up.\nInstead, Mays kept on texting, focusing her attention on her phone she was holding underneath the table.\nHahn, however, wasn\'t going to give up.\nShe looked around and found a softball league, choosing to get involved. Of course, it didn\'t hurt that Mays was a player.\nAnd sometime between whizzing paper footballs past Mays\' head to throwing softballs around together, Hahn got the attention she wanted.\nShe also got a partner.\nMississippi is where the two hard-working moms raise their daughters, Haley, 14, and Jessa, 13.\nAnd it\'s also a place where the family sometimes feels the sting of disapproval.\n"I don\'t like the dirty looks, I don\'t like that when we walk by people talk about me," Hahn said.\n"Most of my friends are pretty cool about it," Jessa said. "I\'ve never had anyone not be my friend because of it."\nThere are a couple of friends whose parents don\'t allow their children to visit the Hahn-Mays house. "But that\'s their problem," Jessa said.\nEven with some of the stares, the family is determined to stay put. At least in some part of Mississippi.\n"We\'re comfortable here," said Hahn, adding she and her family want to move to Jackson, a place she describes as being more open than Houston and closer to the hospital where they take Haley, a special needs child.\nIn the meantime, the family will continue to make an example of themselves, a testament to their normalcy.\n"What we\'re going to have to do is make our presence known and get people to see us as human beings because that\'s what we are, you know, we\'re a family just like any other family," Hahn said. "We get up in the morning, we eat breakfast, the kids go to school, she goes to work, I start my school work."\nAnd Hahn said her family is the reason she will stay and take a stand.\n"If we leave, then that\'s one less couple to stand up and speak out."\nEddie & Justin: A living example\nGrowing up gay in the South isn\'t easy for many members of the LGBT community, but the times, they are changing.\nEddie Outlaw and Justin McPherson have carved out their own little piece of Jackson, the city where they have lived the last nine years. It\'s where their home is, their friends are and their business operates.\nMcPherson said the evidence can be seen by younger Mississippians able to come out in high school, to openly discuss their sexuality with their parents.\n"I will put my life out there as an example of what this looks like," said McPherson, 32. "It does get better."\nWhen he was coming out as a teenager, "it was real bad then, and it\'s done nothing but improve and will continue to improve."\n"I guess for a teenager looking at what\'s happening right now -- from (President Barack Obama) to most of the Democrats in the Senate saying they are for marriage equality and overturning (the Defense of Marriage Act), it sends a message," said Outlaw, 41.\nMcPherson said he wants to show that by owning a business while being openly gay, that there is life after coming out.\n"I know what it\'s like growing up in the South. Eddie knows what its like to grow up in the South," he said. "I want to be an example for them, for their parents."\n"Instead of a paso doble," said Outlaw, referring to a traditional Spanish dance, "we\'ve settled into a slow, steady waltz. We found something that works for us."

California Attorney General Kamala Harris officiates the wedding ceremony of Kristin Perry and Sandy Stiler, plaintiffs in the Prop 8 case, at San Francisco City Hall.\nThe two couples who challenged the law that had barred same-sex marriage in California were married Friday afternoon after a federal appeals court dissolved its stay blocking same-sex marriage in the state.\nOn the eve of San Francisco\'s Pride Weekend, State Attorney General Kamala declared Sandra Stier, 50, and Kris Perry, 48, "spouse and spouse" shortly before 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET) at San Francisco City Hall. In their vows, the couple took each other as "lawfully wedded wife."\n"Right now, we feel really victorious and thrilled and relieved to be at the end of this long journey and just move forward like a regular married couple," Stier said in a conference call with reporters — but not before she introduced Perry as "my beautiful wife."\nStier said she and Perry hadn\'t had time to schedule a honeymoon. But Perry said that after a celebration with "all of the people we love ... Sandy and I will go somewhere alone."\nPaul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo, one of the couples who successfully challenged California\'s Proposition 8, marry in Los Angeles.\nAbout 90 minutes later in Los Angeles, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa married the other couple, Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo, on his last day in office.\nThe ceremony, Katami said, was "about celebrating our private commitment and our public connection."\nAs the ceremony began, Villaraigosa said: "I\'ve done a few of these over the last couple years, but never have I been prouder. Never have I been more joyful than I am today. This is a special moment."\nMany state officials, including Harris and Gov. Jerry Brown, celebrated the decision Friday on Twitter:\nSan Francisco City Hall will stay open until 8 p.m. Friday and will be open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday for marriage licenses. The Los Angeles County registrar and clerk\'s office said it was deputizing extra marriage commissioners and extending days and locations to accommodate an expected rush of weddings.\nGina Alcomendias, the clerk-recorder for Santa Clara County, said few people had shown up at the County Building because the appeals court\'s decision came late in the day.\nBut "we\'re going to be busy Monday, I think — the whole week next week," Alcomendias told NBC Bay Area. "Probably for a long while."\nThe 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals lifted its stay two days after the Supreme Court declined to rule on Proposition 8, thereby upholding a lower court\'s decision overturning the ban. The appeals court had blocked enforcement of that ruling pending the Supreme Court decision.\nThe justices also struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 federal law that barred recognition of same-sex marriages.\nSupreme Court rulings generally don\'t take effect for 25 days. But Harris had called on the 9th Circuit to lift its stay as soon as possible Wednesday after Brown told the state\'s 58 counties to prepare for same-sex marriages.\nBrown issued an order Friday afternoon making that official, declaring that "marriage licenses must be issued to same-sex couples immediately."\nCalifornia Attorney General Kamala Harris instructs the Los Angeles County Clerk by telephone to begin same-sex marriages &quot;immediately.&quot;\nThe Protect Marriage Coalition\'s Proposition 8 Legal Defense Fund, which sponsored the ballot initiative, did not immediately return calls seeking comment. But in a statement, the group said it had been deprived of "our right to ask for reconsideration," calling the appeals court\'s decision an "outrageous act of judicial tyranny."\n"Homosexual marriage is not happening because the people changed their mind," the group said in a statement. "It isn\'t happening because the appellate courts declared a new constitutional right. It\'s happening because enemies of the people have abused their power to manipulate the system and render the people voiceless."\nTheodore Boutros, one of the plaintiffs\' lawyers, said the appeals court was fully within its rights to lift its injunction, which simply restored the status quo in the circuit. Any attempt by opponents to seek reconsideration of the Supreme Court ruling is a separate matter, he said.\nWatch the most-viewed videos on NBCNews.com\nMiranda Leitsinger, Norma Rubio and Sossy Dombourian of NBC News contributed to this report.

Eugene Robinson at The Washington Post provides a snapshot of what\'s at stake:\nDon’t take anything for granted. The conservative activists on the Supreme Court may not be able to halt the inexorable shift toward acceptance of gay marriage, but we probably should expect them to try.\nThe two big cases being argued before the court this week could turn out to be landmarks that confirm the nation’s progress toward marriage equality — or speed bumps that impede it. Either way, the destination is clear: Nearly 60 percent of Americans approve of gay marriage, according to a Post-ABC News poll, including 80 percent of adults under 30. That looks like less a question than a decision. [...]\nChristopher Ott at The Boston Globe:\nOpponents of equality for lesbian and gay people have understood one thing: how quickly their support would evaporate if the freedom to marry arrived and survived anywhere. The speed with which their support collapsed and made way for equality has astonished even most us who worked for it.\nIn just under a decade since the pioneering Massachusetts breakthrough for equality in 2004, the freedom to marry for lesbian and gay couples has gone from something unimagined, by most people, to growing a reality — some might say even commonplace. Nine states plus the District of Columbia have legalized it, Rhode Island recognizes marriages performed elsewhere, and this trend shows no signs of stopping.\nHead below the fold for more analysis on the day\'s top stories.\nSupport now for same-sex marriage — more than half in favor, about one-third against — is roughly the public divide on the question of public school desegregation in 1954 when the Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools in Brown v. Board of Education. But the court’s call then for states to end racial discrimination in public schools “with all deliberate speed” was a big error. It gave states far too much latitude to move slowly and gave them an excuse for resistance, which delayed desegregation in many school districts for many years.\nThe court should avoid that kind of error in the same-sex-marriage cases. It should broadly declare that under the Constitution the right to marry applies equally to all couples, period, and that this principle applies to the federal government and every state.\nMeanwhile, the editors at The Washington Post join in and also write a long editorial supporting marriage equality:\nThe arguments of those defending discrimination against gay couples are beyond far-fetched. Proposition 8’s advocates, for example, contend that restricting marriage to heterosexual couples must be rational because for thousands of years people widely agreed that the institution involved only the union of a man and a woman. That reasoning stinks of the faulty logic used to justify the persistence of all sorts of discrimination. They also argue that marriage’s purpose is to ensure that children are born into stable families; therefore, California should be allowed to limit marriage to only those capable of biological procreation. That is a narrow and insulting view of marriage. Would it then be constitutional to deny sterile heterosexual couples the right to marry? How about older couples? Moreover, lesbians can bear children and gay men can adopt. Why wouldn’t society want their parents to be wed, too?\nOver at CNN, John D. Sutter profiles "the county where no one\'s gay":\nStatistically speaking, Franklin County should be straighter than John Wayne eating Chick-fil-A. The middle-of-nowhere rectangle in southwest Mississippi -- known for its pine forests, hog hunting and an infamous hate crime -- is home to exactly zero same-sex couples, according to an analysis of census data. In other words: It\'s a place where gays don\'t exist. At least not on paper. [...]\nIn a place where "everybody knows everybody," as Richard Pickett put it, very few seem willing to talk about the possibility of gay residents. You could blame that on the would-be gays. "If (a gay couple) did live together, they would probably keep it quiet," the 54-year-old told me. "They\'re not going to march up and down the street with a sign" announcing their homosexuality. The common Franklin County wisdom seems to be that gays, like unicorns or dragons, are living over the next pine-covered hill, out of sight and out of mind. They\'re not my kids. Not my neighbors. They\'re somewhere else. Maybe.\nBut here\'s the thing: There certainly are gay people in Franklin County. And for the most part, they\'re not in the closet. Many are happy to talk about it. It\'s their neighbors and families who aren\'t.\nSwitching topics, Juan Williams at The Hill tells Democrats to stand up to Republican filibuster bullies:\nThe GOP filibuster strategy is proving to be the tool of choice for draining momentum from President Obama’s reelection mandate.\nIt stops the Democratic majority in the senate from controlling the Senate. And it makes it difficult for the president to put his nominees in place to govern the country.\nThe GOP is betting that voters will blame Democrats for the dysfunction in Congress as much as they blame the GOP.\nAnd so far, the bet is paying off, because the press is failing to call out the GOP for an extreme and nasty political strategy of demanding a super-majority of 60 votes —the votes required to break a filibuster — to get anything done.\nPaul McMorrow at The Boston Globe points out that Wall Street is up to its old tricks:\nA lawsuit the federal government filed against JP Morgan in late 2011 alleged the bank consistently overstated the quality of the loans it packaged into mortgage bonds; that it inflated home values to make mortgages seem safer than they were; and that JP Morgan and its brokers didn’t adhere to their own underwriting standards. Federal lawsuits against other Wall Street banks made similar claims. Post-crisis investigations have revealed that outside auditors told banks that they were handling bad mortgages, but the banks stuffed them into bonds and sold them off anyway. The banks did all this while knowing they would have to own any mortgage fraud that investors discovered. Just imagine what they’ll be tempted to pull once they let themselves off that hook.\nKeven Ann Willey at The Dallas Morning News says Michele Bachmann "gives us license to never listen to her again":\nThere comes a point when some folks prove themselves so careless so consistently with the facts that the rest of us should have license to ignore any additional utterance ever to leak from their lips.\nThat time has come with regard to Michele Bachmann.\nThe not-so-esteemed congresswoman from Minnesota crossed a new threshold last week (just how many thresholds can there be?) when she blasted President Obama’s lavish lifestyle of “excess” (a claim of such lavish excess itself that it prompted even Bill O’Reilly to dress her down for it) and called for a repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act “before it literally kills women, kills children, kills senior citizens.”\nBreathtaking. And I don’t mean that in a positive way.

Just after midnight, New Jersey became the fourteenth state to allow same-sex couples to marry with Sen.-elect Corey Booker presiding over unions in Newark. NBC\'s Jay Gray reports.\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie abandoned the state\'s legal challenge to same-sex marriage on Monday, hours after gay couples began tying the knot in the wake of a court ruling.\nChristie said that while he disagreed with the court\'s decision, it "left no ambiguity," making New Jersey the 14th state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage.\nCouples began taking advantage of the new law as soon as they could. Senator-elect Cory Booker officiated at seven weddings in the rotunda at Newark City Hall.\n"It is officially past midnight, marriage is now equal in New Jersey," Booker said to applause and cheers.\nBooker, who had declined to officiate at weddings as mayor of New Jersey until same-sex couples could be included, pronounced the occasion "one of the most magical moments" of his life.\nMayors in cities and towns including Newark, Jersey City, Red Bank, Asbury Park and Lambertville opened their city halls late Sunday to marry couples as soon as the state\'s 72-hour waiting period for licenses was over.\nWhen Booker asked if anyone objected to the marriage of the night\'s first couple — retired advertising executive Joseph Panessidi and LGBTQ educator Orville Bell — a protester yelled that the marriages were "unlawful in the eyes of God and Jesus Christ," The Associated Press reported.\nThe protester was then removed, as Booker continued the ceremony, saying he was "not hearing any substantive and worthy objections."\nNewlywed Bell said he and his new husband felt they were a part of history.\n"We\'re in our sixties, which means we\'ve seen tremendous history of monumental events," Bell told the AP. "This is one of those monumental events, that I can be here today and say I\'m married to another man."\nIn Lambertville, one of the first couples in the state to join in a civil union seven years ago, were finally married.\n"We\'re floating on air," Beth Asaro told the AP following the ceremony. "It\'s like winning the Super Bowl," said Joanne Schailey, her wife and partner of 27 years.\nThe stage for the all the vow-exchanging was set Friday, when the state Supreme Court refused to delay a lower court order that New Jersey should begin recognizing same-sex marriages.\nChristie had appealed that lower court order, but on Monday morning, he ordered it dropped.\n"Chief Justice Rabner left no ambiguity about the unanimous court\'s view on the ultimate decision in this matter when he wrote, \'same-sex couples who cannot marry are not treated equally under the law today,\'" he said in a statement.\nLydia Torres, 44, and Jenelle Torres, 42, hug each other after been married by Senator-elect Cory Booker at City Hall in Newark, N.J., early on Monday.\n"Although the Governor strongly disagrees with the Court substituting its judgment for the constitutional process of the elected branches or a vote of the people, the Court has now spoken clearly as to their view of the New Jersey Constitution and, therefore, same-sex marriage is the law.\n"The Governor will do his constitutional duty and ensure his Administration enforces the law as dictated by the New Jersey Supreme Court."\nHayley Gorenberg, who was the lead lawyer on the case for gay-rights group Lambda Legal, said she experienced "a collision of joy and momentary disbelief" when she heard the news.\n"It’s been so long coming and that has been so wrong, and this is so right," she said. "To have all doubt erased is momentous."\nNew Jersey legally recognizing same-sex marriage sent couples throughout the state into a frantic scramble, with Christie instructing the state’s Department of Health to cooperate with municipalities to issue licenses.\nNewark mayor and senator-elect Cory Booker performed the first of many same-sex marriages in the early hours of Monday morning. New Jersey is now the 14 U.S. state to allow gay marriage.\nChristie, a Republican with a national profile, is a popular figure in New Jersey, but his move to drop the appeal could cause him some support if he decides to run for president.\nWhile support for gay marriage has increased across the country, that\'s not the case among Republican primary voters.\nAn April NBC/WSJ poll found 53% of Americans said they favored gay marriage, but just 27% of Republican respondents supported it.\nIf the abandoned appeal were to become an issue in a GOP primary, Christie could counter that "activist" judges were responsible, but that would be the same position that Mitt Romney found himself in when he had to explain to a GOP electorate how gay marriage was legalized on his watch as governor of Massachusetts.\nThe Associated Press and NBC News\' Mark Murray, Alexandra Moe and Simon Moya-Smith contributed to this report.\nRelated:\nThis story was originally published on Mon Oct 21, 2013 5:24 AM E

As activists push states to recognize gay marriages, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie — conservative Republican governor in a blue state and a 2016 presidential possibility — is walking a fine line between two electorates and two elections.\nChristie vetoed same-sex marriage legislation last year and severely criticized the Supreme Court\'s decision striking down a ban on federal rights for same-sex married couples. At the same time, he is "adamant\'\' that same-sex couples deserve equal legal protection, wants a referendum on gay marriage, and vows to abide by a same-sex marriage law if the voters approve it.\nHe\'s tiptoeing between constituencies. First are the voters of New Jersey: polls show they favor same-sex marriage, and Christie wants them to reelect him in November by a big margin. Then there are Republican caucus-goers in Iowa. Christie needs their backing if he runs for president in 2016; in 2012, evangelical conservatives, who generally oppose gay marriage, made up 57% of Republican caucusgoers in the state, according to exit polls.\nAnd there is a third group of voters to think about: swing voters across the nation, who might go for a Republican presidential nominee who is sufficiently centrist.\nTo appeal to those voters, Christie "will want to not be perceived to be as far right as many Republicans are,\'\' says David Boaz of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. "That\'s a lot of tightropes to walk.\'\'\nChristie, who is Roman Catholic, has said he does not believe being gay is a choice, nor is it a sin, and that he has gay friends who argue the issue with him. Marriage, he said last year on CNN, is "special and unique in society.\'\' He followed his veto in of the gay-marriage bill in February 2012 with a call for a statewide referendum on whether to allow same-sex marriage by constitutional amendment.\n"When you want to change the core of a 2,000 year-old institution, the way to do that is to put it in front of the voters,\'\' he told reporters July 2.\nA referendum would allow same-sex marriage to pass in New Jersey without his fingerprints — or as he said at a town-hall-style meeting last month: "I don\'t have to compromise my principles that I believe in and someone else doesn\'t have to compromise theirs.\'\'\nChristie is in the same position as his party. The Republican platform says marriage is only for couples of different sexes, but Chairman Reince Priebus has said that the Republican Party should be open to those who favor same-sex marriage. "I don\'t believe we need to act like Old Testament heretics," he told USA TODAY in March. Instead, Republicans "have to strike a balance between principle and grace and respect.\'\'\nGarden State Equality, a leading advocate for same-sex marriage in New Jersey, opposes a referendum saying civil rights should not be on the ballot. "It should never be up to the majority to vote on the rights of the minority,\'\' spokesman T.J. Helmstetter said.\nSame-sex marriage advocates are now lobbying New Jersey legislators to override Christie\'s veto before the end of the year, when the window to do so expires. Christie is too powerful a party leader to let that happen, says Ben Dworkin, director of Rider University\'s Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics.\n"I can\'t envision a situation where the Republican votes that are needed to get the two-thirds override would come, given this administration\'s history,\'\' Dworkin says. "The Christie administration sees no reason why any Republican should really ever override a Republican governor. That\'s their logic, so I\'d be shocked if it ever got to happen."\nLast year, Christie nominated a gay judge (a Republican) to the state Supreme Court, a first for the state. Last month, when the Supreme Court ruled on Defense of Marriage Act, he called it "insulting" to the Congress and president which passed the law.\nTroy Stevenson, executive director of Garden State Equality, said, "I don\'t like to pretend I can get inside the mind of the governor, but I think the closer we get to him having future political ambitions the more staunch his opposition gets to marriage equality."\nBut Jimmy LaSalvia, a founder of GOProud, a Republican gay-rights group that favors same-sex marriage, gives Christie credit for not trying to change the subject. "He\'s one Republican who doesn\'t say \'I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. We need jobs and the economy is hurting,\'\'\' says LaSalvia, who now works with the ACLU trying to pass same-sex marriage state by state. "He\'s willing to talk through the issue in a way that no other Republican has the balls to do.\'\'\nChristie has to make his political calculus now, even though "he doesn\'t know how much public opinion will change between now and 2016,\'\' Boaz says. "Will people be more liberal then? Is the country? Yes. But the Republican primary electorate, maybe not so much.\'\'\nPublic opinion on gay marriage has changed rapidly. Four years ago, 37% of Americans favored same-sex marrage. Now, 51% do, according to the Pew Research Center.\nIowa and New Hampshire, traditionally the first states to hold presidential nominating contests, both allow same-sex marriage – which could mean voters there no longer focus on it as an issue. "Those people in those states have been living with (same-sex marriage) for a while,\'\' LaSalvia says. "I don\'t think any of us knows how the issue is going to play in 2016 because it\'s moving so fast.\'\' An October poll sponsored by the Iowa Republican, a news site, showed Iowans favor gay marriage 49% to 42%.\nIowa has allowed gays to marry since a 2009 state Supreme Court decision – and voters remain conflicted about it, says pollster Ann Selzer, who conducts the Iowa Poll for the Des Moines Register, "You ask them on the street and nobody can say that their lives have been affected. But you ask them if they like it and they don\'t.\'\' In a poll taken a month after the 2012 caucuses, 64% of Republicans favored a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.

In its 2003 case, the Supreme Court overruled previous sexuality precedents by declaring unconstitutional laws that made homosexual sodomy a crime, holding that although the Constitution says nothing about sex or marriage, there is nonetheless a right to consensual sexual activity between adults that government cannot regulate. This was over the vigorous dissent of conservative justices, who said that the Constitution commits such questions of marriage and morality to the states and the democratic process, and that therefore federal courts have no power to impose their own moral judgments.

/\nActor and producer Clint Eastwood is seen in September 2012 in Westwood, Calif.\nClint Eastwood has joined about 130 self-described moderate and conservativeRepublicans in signing a brief to the Supreme Court arguing against California’s Proposition 8, which bans marriage for same-sex couples.\nFormer Bush administration officials, including Paul Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of Defense, and Tom Ridge, former Pennsylvania governor and Secretary of Homeland Security, also were among those who signed the brief, which argued that the Constitution prohibits denying same-sex couples access to the legal rights and responsibilities of marriage, according to a copy of the brief released Thursday by the American Foundation for Equal Rights.\nBreitbart.com, which first reported that Eastwood had signed the brief, said he was a "long-time Republican with strong libertarian leanings," who had "become increasingly vocal politically." Eastwood\'s conversation with an empty chair representing President Barack Obama on the final day of the Republican convention briefly became a major topic on the campaign last fall.\nThe nation’s high court will hear arguments in the case on March 26. Thursday is the last day for briefs to be filed in the case, and officials told NBC\'s Pete Williams that the Justice Department will urge the court to approve gay marriage in California.\nSix other former governors, including Jon Huntsman of Utah and Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, and ten former and two current members of Congress signed the brief, which was organized by AFER. Members of the George W. Bush, Mitt Romney and Sen. John McCain presidential campaigns also signed.\nIn the brief, the group said it was better for children to grow up with married parents, and that legalizing same-sex marriage would ease couples’ access to benefits and rights afforded to heterosexual couples but would pose “no credible threat to religious freedom or to the institution of religious marriage.”\nThey noted that many of those adding their names did not previously support same-sex marriage. But since a number of states have allowed gays and lesbians to wed, they, "like many Americans, have reexamined the evidence and their own positions and have concluded that there is no legitimate, fact-based reason for denying same-sex couples the same recognition in law that is available to opposite-sex couples."\nRather, they “concluded that marriage is strengthened, not undermined, and its benefits and importance to society as well as the support and stability it gives to children and families promoted, not undercut, by providing access to civil marriage for same-sex couples,” the brief continued.\nSome on the list included who have had a change of heart on the issue include Meg Whitman, the Republican candidate for California governor in 2010, and David Frum, a special assistant to Bush from 2001 to 2002.\nNumerous briefs have been filed in support of Prop. 8 by 20 states, religious groups, academics and legal scholars, as well as many against by businesses, labor unions, veterans, California plus thirteen states as well as the District of Columbia, and gay rights and religious groups.\nNational Football League players, Chris Kluwe, a punter for the Minnesota Vikings, and Bredon Ayanbadejo, a linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens, also filed a separate brief in the case that was released Thursday afternoon. The pair has been outspoken supporters of gay rights.\nThe California Supreme Court said in 2008 that the state had to allow same-sex marriage, and for a short period, some 18,000 same-sex couples wed in the Golden State. But with the passage of Prop. 8 later that same year, gays and lesbians were later prohibited from marrying. Various lower courts said the law was unconstitutional, with the most recent one determining such a fundamental right like marriage, that gays and lesbians had once enjoyed, could not be taken away.\nThe Supreme Court will also hear arguments in late March on Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which bars federal recognition of same-sex marriage. The Obama administration has encouraged the justices to strike down Section 3. In its argument, the administration noted that Proposition 8 and similar measures in other states were evidence that anti-gay discrimination remained a major problem.\nRelated:\nWidow to Supreme Court: Same-sex marriage ban is unconstitutional\nUS asks Supreme Court to strike down law denying benefits to same-sex couples\nSupreme Court to take up same-sex marriage issue\nPopular Discussio

GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) — In one of their most dramatic choices in a century, local leaders of the Boy Scouts of America voted Thursday on whether to ease a divisive ban and allow openly gay boys to be accepted into the nation's leading youth organization.\nWhether yes or no, the result will bitterly disappoint many. The decision expected Thursday evening could trigger defections among those on the losing side.\nCasting ballots were about 1,400 voting members of BSA's National Council who were attending their annual meeting at a conference center not far from BSA headquarters in suburban Dallas.\nAt stake was a proposal drafted by the BSA's governing executive committee that says boys could no longer be excluded from Scouting solely on the basis of sexual orientation. A longstanding ban on gay adult leaders would remain in place.\nWhatever the outcome, the vote will not end the wrenching debate over the Scouts' membership policy.\nSome conservative churches that sponsor Scout units want to continue excluding gay youths, and in some cases have threatened to leave the BSA if the ban were lifted.\nMore liberal Scout leaders — while supporting the proposal to accept gay youth — have made clear they want the ban on gay adults lifted as well. If the full no-gays policy is maintained, some units in liberal areas may consider either leaving the Scouts or openly defying the ban.\nHowever the vote goes, the BSA could take a hit financially. Many Scout units in conservative areas fear their local donors will stop giving if the ban on gay youth is lifted, while many major corporate donors are likely to withhold donations if the ban remains.\nIn January, the BSA executive committee suggested a plan to give sponsors of local Scout units the option of admitting gays as both youth members and adult leaders or continuing to exclude them. However, the plan won little praise, and the BSA changed course after assessing responses to surveys sent out starting in February to members of the Scouting community.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah took its fight against gay marriage to the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday, asking the high court to suspend same-sex unions that became legal when a judge struck down the state\'s voter-approved ban.\nThe heavily Mormon state wants the marriages to stop while it appeals a judge\'s decision, which said banning gay couples from marrying violates their right to equal treatment under the law.\nIn papers filed Tuesday, the state asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor to overturn a decision that has led to more than 900 gay marriages in Utah. Sotomayor handles emergency requests from Utah and other Rocky Mountain states.\nSotomayor responded by setting a deadline of by noon Friday for legal briefs from same-sex couples. She can act by herself or get the rest of the court involved.\n"Numerous same-sex marriages are now occurring every day in Utah," Utah lawyers complain in the filing. "Each one is an affront not only to the interests of the state and its citizens in being able to define marriage through ordinary democratic channels, but also to this court\'s unique role as final arbiter."\nAlso Tuesday, the Utah Attorney General\'s Office advertised a formal bid request to outside law firms for help preparing the appeals.\nState officials have said it could cost $2 million, bringing criticism from a lawyer for couples who sued to overturn the ban and say Utah should give up the fight.\n"We are disappointed that Utah will spend millions of dollars in taxpayer\'s money, to attempt to reinstate laws which deny due process and equal protection to all of Utah\'s citizens," the lawyer, James Magleby, said Tuesday.\nUtah insists that states have the authority to define marriage as between a man and woman. "That states have a powerful interest in controlling the definition of marriage within their borders is indisputable," Utah said in the filing.\nU.S. District Judge Robert Shelby\'s decision on Dec. 20 came as a shock to many in the state, which approved the ban on same-sex marriage in 2004.

Gov. Pat Quinn on Wednesday put his signature on a historic measure making Illinois the 16th state to allow same-sex marriage, capping a 40-year push for gay rights that picked up major momentum during the past decade.\nPlaying master of ceremonies during an hourlong event, the re-election-seeking Democratic governor slowly signed the bill with 100 pens that quickly became souvenirs. He did so at a desk shipped from Springfield that the administration said President Abraham Lincoln used to write his first inaugural address in 1861 — a speech on the cusp of the Civil War that called on Americans to heed "the better angels of our nature."\nBut it was another Lincoln speech that Quinn referenced as he spoke to about 2,300 supporters gathered at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n"In the very beginning of the Gettysburg Address, President Abraham Lincoln of Illinois said that our nation was conceived in liberty. And he said it\'s dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal, and that\'s really what we\'re celebrating today," he said. "It\'s a triumph of democracy."\nSigns were banned for security reasons, but attendees shared celebratory kisses and waved miniature rainbow flags featuring the outline of Illinois.\nAmong the first in the door were Jan Arnold and Mary Anderson, of Oak Park, who brought their 8-year-old son to witness the bill-signing. The couple have been together for 15 years but said they got tired of waiting on Illinois to pass gay marriage and were legally married in Iowa in 2011.\nTheir union now will be recognized in Illinois, which Anderson said will free her family from second-class status and means they no longer have to carry a "dossier" of legal paperwork to prove their relationship should an emergency occur.\n"We\'re finally safe and protected in our home state," Anderson said. "We\'ll have the same protections that our straight friends do."\nThe bill-signing illustrated the rapidly changing views in Illinois and the nation on gay rights. Supporters first introduced an anti-discrimination bill in the legislature in 1974. It didn\'t became law until 2005. It took an additional six years for civil unions to be approved, but only about half that time for the gay marriage measure.\nStill, support for same-sex marriage is far from universal in Illinois. As politicians talked up the merits of gay marriage in Chicago, down in Springfield, a crowd gathered for an exorcism by the local Catholic bishop in protest of the governor\'s action.\n"It is not the church that must change to confirm its teachings to the views of the world, but it is each individual who is called to be configured to Christ," Bishop Thomas Paprocki said during a service delivered mostly in Latin.\nThe new law changes the definition of marriage in Illinois from an act between a man and a woman to one between two people. Civil unions could be converted to marriages within a year of the law going on the books. About 6,500 applications for civil unions have been filed since 2011, with about 4,000 originating in Cook County.\nAs it stands, the bill won\'t take effect until June 1, which is when the first marriage ceremonies could take place. That date falls on a Sunday, but officials with Cook County Clerk David Orr\'s office said they will be ready for what they expect to be a huge demand. That includes the possibility of providing special waivers so couples don\'t have to wait until the day after receiving wedding licenses before they can be married.\nThe start date could be moved up under a measure backed by Sen. Don Harmon, a Democrat from Oak Park. If that bill is passed, gay marriage would go into effect immediately upon Quinn\'s signature. The measure could be called for a vote when lawmakers return to Springfield in the new year, though they face a light legislative schedule before the March 18 primary election.\nHarmon said he\'s weighing whether it\'s fair to ask his colleagues to take another tough vote so soon after voting for gay marriage, acknowledging that a later effective date was the trade-off for passing the proposal this fall because a delay in implementation meant just 60 House votes were needed to pass the bill instead of 71.\nThe lag time did little to dampen spirits Wednesday, as supporters noted just how far Illinois has come in supporting gay rights in a relatively short time.\nCasey Cameron, 38, who traveled from St. Elmo in southern Illinois, noted that just eight years ago gay people in Illinois were fighting for basic rights such as equal housing and employment opportunities. "It took a long time and a very tall mountain to get to that, and to finally see this is quite an amazing bit of accomplishment for the state," Cameron said.\nThe celebratory tone was a marked departure from late May, when the legislation stalled in the House after first passing the Senate on Valentine\'s Day. Supporters funneled their disappointment into action, launching a summerlong lobbying blitz that was soon buoyed by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down the definition of marriage as between one man and one woman for the purpose of receiving federal benefits.\nThat helped sway about a dozen lawmakers who spent much of the summer undecided. Another nudge came from powerful House Speaker Michael Madigan, who personally lobbied some members to vote for the bill. Madigan, who represents a Southwest Side district, also is chairman of the state Democratic Party. That means he controls the purse strings to large chests of campaign money that could be vital should one of his members face a primary challenge over their decision to vote in favor of gay marriage.\nOn Wednesday, Madigan gave much of the credit to sponsoring Sen. Heather Steans and Rep. Greg Harris, both Chicago Democrats, who at one point faced protests from some gay rights advocates unhappy with the way Madigan was handling the bill. With Quinn\'s signature, Harris was able to shrug off much of those criticisms.\n"We\'re here to celebrate family, commitment, equality, love, courage and community," Harris said, before taking a dig at conservative opposition. "Marriage is a family value."\nAlthough the law would not force religious organizations to perform or host same-sex weddings, some faith groups contend it doesn\'t offer enough protections. They argue, for example, that they may be forced to provide health insurance to an employee\'s same-sex spouse.\nFurther, they contend it offers little in the way of protections for wedding photographers, bakers or other service providers who could face legal action for refusing to work for gay couples. Supporters argue that the benefits of the law outweigh those concerns.

Two gay men who have been a couple for 14 years have become the first to register to marry in Uruguay, hours after a law came into force allowing same-sex marriages in the country.\nRodrigo Borda, 39, and Sergio Miranda, 45, said it was a day of much joy and emotion, but also of responsibility.\nPresident Jose Mujica signed the legislation in May, but it took 90 days to come into effect.\nUruguay is the second South American nation to pass a gay-marriage law.\nMr Borda and Mr Miranda said they would celebrate their wedding in September.\nIt would be a "very public affair", not only because they wanted to share the moment with "all the world", but also because they wanted "to give an example to those gay couples who may be thinking about getting married but don\'t dare to", the couple added.\nThree years ago, Argentina became the first country in Latin America to allow same-sex marriages.\nReforms\nSince then, Brazil\'s Supreme Court overwhelmingly voted in favour of granting same-sex couples the same legal rights as married heterosexuals, effectively authorising gay marriage.\nIn Colombia, a judge recently ordered a notary to sign a document which - while not a marriage certificate - in effect gave a same-sex couple the same rights as a heterosexual one.\nIn Mexico, legislation on same-sex unions is a matter for individual states. Gay marriage is legal in the capital and the southern state of Quintana Roo, while the states of Coahuila and Colima allow gay couples to enter into civil unions. Gay marriage remains illegal in the rest of the country.\nThe gay-marriage bill is among a series of liberal reforms in Uruguay backed by President Mujica.\nSince the left-wing politician came to power, parliament has also passed a law allowing abortion beyond cases of rape, incest or threats to a woman\'s health.\nLast week, the House of Representatives voted in favour of a bill which, if passed by the Senate, will legalise marijuana and put its production and sale into the hands of the state.

Having taken the appeal, they cannot easily decide to avoid the substantive question of whether same-sex couples have a constitutionally protected right to marry in California and elsewhere in the country.\nIf the court decides the case on the merits, it is hard to imagine that a majority could be swayed by the arguments offered by Charles Cooper, the lawyer for the marriage ban’s supporters. Even if his presentation had been more fluent, there was no way to overcome the incoherence of his position.\nThe core of Mr. Cooper’s argument was that a ruling allowing same-sex marriage would be “redefining” marriage in a way that undermines the “responsible procreation” of children.

As conservatives continue to grapple with how they -- and the Republican Party at large -- should handle the issue of gay marriage, some prominent voices are coming out to either endorse or condemn pushes for the movement to embrace same-sex nuptials. Among those personalities is former presidential candidate Rick Santorum.\nIn an interview with the Des Moines Register, the politician said that embracing gay marriage would be "suicidal" for the party. The former senator also noted that some Republicans, like Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, and Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who have openly endorsed gay marriage are no different than those politicians who parted ideological ways from the party over the abortion issue in the 1960s and 1970s.\nFormer GOP presidential candidate and former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA) (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n"I\'m sure you could go back and read stories, oh, you know, \'The Republican party\'s going to change. This is the future.\' Obviously that didn\'t happen," Santorum told the outlet. "I think you\'re going to see the same stories written now and it\'s not going to happen. The Republican party\'s not going to change on this issue. In my opinion it would be suicidal if it did."\nSantorum went on to note that speaking about how best to communicate messages is fine, but that transforming "foundational principles" is another story -- one that could prove problematic for the GOP.\n"Just because some of those things happen to be popular right now doesn\'t mean the Republican party should follow suit," he noted.\nFormer Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum gestures as he speaks at the 40th annual Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md. on Friday, March 15, 2013. Credit: AP\nAs far as the Supreme Court goes on the marriage front, Santorum believes that the nation\'s highest court won\'t follow the same pattern it embraced in deciding Roe v. Wade, the contentious abortion case that legalized the procedure back in 1973.

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration came out forcefully Thursday against California\'s ban on same-sex marriage and, by extension, implicated similar bans in 37 other states.\nIn a brief to the Supreme Court, which will hear two landmark same-sex marriage cases in late March, the Justice Department argued that gay and lesbian couples should have the same right to marry as heterosexuals.\n"The government seeks to vindicate the defining constitutional ideal of equal treatment under the law," Attorney General Eric Holder said. "Throughout history, we have seen the unjust consequences of decisions and policies rooted in discrimination."\nThe brief marks the first time the administration has weighed in on the constitutionality of any state ban on gay marriage. Although it was aimed at the voter initiative passed in California in 2008, it put the administration squarely against other such prohibitions. It urged the court to subject the state\'s ban to a difficult legal standard that no state prohibition is likely to meet.\nIn particular, the brief implicated the other states that, like California, allow domestic partnerships or civil unions: Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island.\n"The designation of marriage ... confers a special validation of the relationship between two individuals and conveys a message to society that domestic partnerships or civil unions cannot match," the brief states. "Proposition 8\'s denial of marriage to same-sex couples, particularly where California at the same time grants same-sex partners all the substantive rights of marriage, violates equal protection."\nTheodore Boutrous, a partner in the law firm Gibson Dunn, which is representing the two same-sex couples who filed the case initially, said the administration\'s arguments represent "a clear path to marriage equality across the United States."\nThe court filing completes President Obama\'s self-described evolution on gay marriage and puts his administration squarely on the side of gay rights groups and the nine states where same-sex marriage is legal.\nThe president opposed California\'s ban, Proposition 8, during his 2008 campaign but refused to endorse gay marriage. He made that endorsement during last year\'s campaign but said the issue should be decided by the states.\nThen, in evocative language in this year\'s inaugural address, Obama equated gay rights to past battles on behalf of women and African Americans by mentioning Stonewall, the New York City bar that was the site of 1969\'s historic gay rights riots.\n"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law," Obama said. "For if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well."\nThe action was heralded by groups that seek to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide.\n"President Obama and the solicitor general have taken another historic step forward, consistent with the great civil rights battles of our nation\'s history," said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which brought the challenge to Proposition 8.\nConservative groups criticized the decision to weigh in against the gay marriage ban, particularly since Obama once said it should be left to the states. Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said the president was "putting allegiance to extreme liberal social policies ahead of constitutional principle."\nThe high court has reserved two days in late March to consider the California ban on gay marriage and the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. Both have been declared unconstitutional by lower courts, decisions which are being challenged by gay-marriage opponents.\nProposition 8 was approved by California voters in November 2008 to block a state Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Ever since, gay couples have been blocked from marrying in the nation\'s most populous state. A final ruling overturning the ban would open the floodgates to thousands of new same-sex marriages there.\nWhat effect a court ruling striking down Proposition 8 would have on other states is not clear. The justices could rule narrowly, as a federal appeals court did, holding only that voters cannot take away a right previously enjoyed, however briefly, by Californians. But a more sweeping decision declaring marriage rights for gays and lesbians would endanger all state bans.\nThe Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton in 1996 as a response to a Hawaii Supreme Court ruling that questioned the denial of a marriage license to a same-sex couple. The federal law has blocked legally married couples from receiving federal benefits in Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia.\nThe administration is leading the effort to overturn DOMA in the case of Edith Windsor, an 83-year-old New York widow who was forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes when her lesbian spouse died in 2009. Had she been married to a man, she would have faced no inheritance tax.\nThe new filing is more significant, however, because the administration did not have to get involved at all. Two same-sex couples are contesting Proposition 8 along with the state of California, while organizations that promoted the 2008 voter initiative are defending it.\nIn the Windsor case, the Justice Department\'s brief argues that gays and lesbians have been subjected to a long history of discrimination, and it refers specifically to the California marriage ban as an example.\nOn the subject of states\' rights vs. the Constitution, its brief to the Supreme Court states: "Deference to the democratic process must give way to the fundamental constitutional command of equal treatment under law."\nPolls have been shifting toward approval of gay marriage. In a December USA TODAY survey, 53% of Americans said same-sex couples deserve the same marriage rights as heterosexual couples, up from 40% in 2009.\nCalifornia\'s ban has attracted 37 "friend of the court" briefs, mostly from conservative and religious groups. Opponents of the ban have until today to file their briefs, and until Friday in the Defense of Marriage Act case. They were coming in from a variety of groups on the political left and right:\nScores of major companies, including Apple, Cisco, Facebook, Levi Strauss, Verizon and Xerox, argue in the California case that marriage equality "is a business imperative." Others, including Amazon, Citigroup, Google and Starbucks, say that DOMA forces them to discriminate against their own employees.\nMore than 100 Republicans and conservatives signed a brief organized by Ken Mehlman, former chairman of the Republican National Committee and head of President George W. Bush\'s 2004 re-election campaign.\nA coalition of religious organizations representing Episcopal, Lutheran, Methodist, Quaker, Presbyterian and Jewish faiths endorsed what they called "civil" marriage equality, which they said does not impinge on religious beliefs.\nThe liberal Constitutional Accountability Center joined with the libertarian Cato Institute on a brief, arguing that marriage cannot be denied "for invidious or arbitrary reasons," Cato\'s Ilya Shapiro said.\nTwo National Football League players — Brendon Ayanbadejo of the Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens and Chris Kluwe of the Minnesota Vikings — filed a brief because, they said, sports figures can help shape public opinion and urge "societal progress."

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — For Mina Meyer and Sharon Raphael, two women in their 70s who fell in love more than four decades ago and have been married for more than four years, the U.S. Supreme Court\'s pending consideration of a law that prohibits the federal government from recognizing unions like theirs is about more than civil rights. It\'s about buying a new roof for their California home, replacing their 2005 Toyota Camry, and ensuring Meyer doesn\'t take a financial hit if Raphael dies first.\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral arguments this month in a challenge to a provision of the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, that denies legally married gay and lesbian couples federal benefits available to heterosexual married couples, including tax and Social Security benefits. A decision is not expected until the end of June, but accountants and tax attorneys anticipating the 18-year-old law\'s demise are already encouraging same-sex couples like Raphael and Meyer to seek prospective tax refunds, back retirement payments and other spousal subsidies they may have been denied.\nIt is unclear how the justices might rule, but the Obama administration and former President Bill Clinton, who signed the act into law, have urged the court to overturn it on grounds that it violates the civil rights of gay Americans. DOMA supporters, including House Republicans led by Speaker John Boehner, argue that Congress — not the court — should decide as public opinion for same-sex marriage grows. Other conservative groups argue that spousal benefits should be reserved only for couples of the opposite sex.\nPart of the urgency for couples to act stems from deadlines established under the U.S. tax code, which gives taxpayers three years to file protective claims for income and estate tax refunds. Same-sex couples or surviving spouses who were legally married before or during 2009 would therefore have until April 15 of this year to submit amended returns claiming overpayments on income for that tax year, said Vickie Henry, a senior staff attorney at Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders.\nAt the time, gay unions were legal in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa and Vermont, and briefly had been in California. New York and the District of Columbia, which have since legalized same-sex unions, also recognized marriages performed in other states or countries.\nWhile married couples from those jurisdictions would have the strongest cases, couples from states such as Hawaii, Nevada and Illinois that treat domestic partnerships and civil unions as the same as marriage for tax purposes might also see federal refunds depending on how the Supreme Court rules, said Pat Cain, a federal tax expert at the Santa Clara University School of Law.\n"On the income tax side, anybody who would benefit from filing jointly and who would be eligible to do so if DOMA falls should consider filing amended tax returns for the applicable years," Cain said.\nThe sums at stake are not inconsequential. The case the justices accepted, for example, involves a New York state widow, Edith Windsor, 83, who is seeking a refund of the $363,000 she had to pay in estate taxes after her wife, Thea Spyer, died in 2009. If Windsor had not been married to another woman, her tax bill would have been $0 because married U.S. citizens are allowed to pass their assets onto their spouses tax-free — but only if the surviving spouse is of the opposite sex.\nGerald McIntyre, directing attorney at the National Senior Citizens Law Center, said Social Security benefits, which kick in based on the date of application, are where gay couples have lost the most and stand the most to gain.\nLower-earning spouses such as Meyer have been doubly penalized under DOMA, McIntrye said, first by being unable to claim the spousal benefit that allows married heterosexuals to increase their monthly benefits by drawing half of a husband or wife\'s Social Security, then being deemed ineligible for survivor benefits that are equal to what a deceased spouse got in retirement each month.\nA 2009 study by The Williams Institute, a think tank on sexual orientation and the law at the University of California, Los Angeles, estimated that gay couples received an average of $3,060 less a year in Social Security benefits than married straight couples. For lesbian couples, the disparity rose to $5,412. The same study found that gay or lesbian widows or widowers lost out on more than $5,700 a year in survivor benefits than their straight counterparts received.\nIn the case of retirees Raphael and Meyer, it could mean an additional $7,335 year in Social Security benefits because Meyer, who worked in office jobs and a bookstore, would be entitled to the Social Security benefits of Raphael, who earned considerably more as a college professor for 40 years. That would boost their fixed monthly income by about 10 percent. Last year, on the advice of a professional colleague and with the high court poised to decide if DOMA is constitutional, Meyer applied for more than a year\'s worth of retroactive benefits as well as bigger future checks if the law is struck down.\n"This is not the only money we live on, but it does make a big difference," said Meyer, 73, who also would see her Social Security checks more than quadruple in the event she is widowed and the court overturns the act. "That $700 a month is $700 a month."\nOther married same-sex couples may end up paying more in taxes if DOMA is overturned, due to the so-called federal "marriage penalty." Janis Cowhey McDonagh, a tax attorney in the New York office of accounting firm Marcum LLP, (equals) has been encouraging many of her clients in same-sex marriages to get their returns in order before the Supreme Court rules.\n"If it\'s better for them to file single even though they are married, I tell them they need to file before DOMA comes down, because if DOMA comes down, they won\'t have the choice," she said.\n___

Calling the killing of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin a "tragic, unnecessary shooting," Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday repeated the Justice Department\'s intention to take a fresh look at the case and evaluate whether federal prosecutors could bring charges of their own.\nA decision is very likely months away. But several legal experts say it would be surprising if the federal government filed a criminal case against George Zimmerman.\n"Based on what\'s in the public eye, it would be very difficult to get a conviction in this case," said Samuel Bagenstos, a former top official in the Justice Department\'s Civil Rights Division.\nIf the government were to bring a criminal case, it would most likely invoke the four-year old federal hate crime statute named for Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, both of whom were killed in vicious bias attacks. Shepard was targeted in Wyoming because he was gay. Byrd was singled out in Texas because he was black.\nPart of the federal law is a provision making it a crime to cause "bodily injury to any person ... because of the actual or perceived race" of the victim. It\'s that element of intent that makes prosecutions under the statute so difficult.\nThe Justice Department will take a fresh look at what federal investigators learned about the shooting and at the evidence gathered for the George Zimmerman trial. But proving intent is very difficult. The government has gotten convictions under the Hate Crimes law in cases where there has been strong evidence showing racial motivation. NBC\'s Pete Williams reports.\n"Usually when you have a successful prosecution, you have multiple statements made by the defendant about the victim\'s race while the defendant is attacking, or you have a group of people that went out looking for someone of a particular race to attack," Bagenstos said.\n"Proving what\'s on somebody eles\'s mind is as difficult thing to do in the law as possible."\nHe and other former civil rights prosecutors say it would not be enough for the Justice Department to claim that George Zimmerman started following Trayvon Martin because of his race. The government would also have to convince a jury that Martin was killed because of his race, not because of self-defense or some other motive, the experts said.\nWilliam Yeomans, another former DOJ Civil Rights Division official noted, "That would be the big hurdle: establishing that George Zimmerman was thinking about race when he inflicted the bodily injury."\nYeomans said it would provide at best a starting point for a federal prosecution. "You could make the argument that because the incident was initiated because of race, that should suffice. But a jury would be free to find that that was not adequate."\nProving intent, he agreed, is the hardest challenge in bringing a successful prosecution in hate crime cases. "It\'s extremely difficult to establish beyond a reasonable doubt what was in the defendant\'s mind when he committed the act."\nAfter the verdict on Saturday, defense lawyer Mark O’Mara said race had not played any role in Zimmerman’s actions that night and said his client had been made a “scapegoat” by civil rights advocates.\n"I think that things would have been different if George Zimmerman was black for this reason: he never would have been charged with a crime," he said.\n"The facts that night, [it] was not borne out that he acted in a racial way," O’Mara added. "His history is a non-racist."\nA Justice Department statement on Sunday was carefully worded to avoid generating an expectation that the federal government would ultimately choose to file charges in the case.\nIt said experienced prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation "of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction."\nGeorge Zimmerman has sued NBC Universal for defamation. The company strongly denies the allegation.\nPopular Discussio

I have never understood why it takes so much money and time to execute a person like this who had no remorse in taking human life so many times. I wish we could speed up our judicial system for these kind of cases. Why do we wait so long spend so much of the tax payers money to keep this man alive and B.S with lawyers. I have the hardest time understanding shoot, inject, decapitate use in the old days. That it cost so much money.\n\nThis guy could have been off this earth by now for half the cost. The system is designed to make money and that's the truth.", 'type': 'post'}, {'date': 'Wed, 20 Nov 2013 20:20:39 GMT', 'humanLanguage': 'en', 'author': 'DEWBooks', 'authorUrl': 'http://dewbooks.newsvine.com/', 'diffbotUri': 'post|3|2013829769', 'html': '<p>How about putting criminals like him in a freezer until death (hopefully for 30 years or so), hooked up to a computer that makes them experience, die, and re-live the crime they did to their victims?

George Zimmerman was back in court today for a hearing on the start date for his trial on murder charges. Zimmerman, of course, was the Hispanic neighborhood watchman in Sanford, Florida, who trailed a young black man named Trayvon Martin after calling 911, got into an altercation with Martin in which Martin ended up pounding Zimmerman’s head into the pavement, and then ended up shooting Martin in the chest. The media used the Zimmerman case as an opportunity to over their supposed racial intolerance. Even the President of the United States weighed in in the midst of an election cycle, suggesting that if he had a son, he’d look like Trayvon Martin.

In the emotional aftermath of the Trayvon Martin killing last year, Attorney General Eric Holder signaled the unlikelihood of filing federal hate crimes charges against admitted shooter George Zimmerman.\n"For a federal hate crime, we have to prove the highest standard in the law," Holder said in April 2012, 45 days after Zimmerman shot the African American teenager in what was depicted by civil rights groups as a racially motivated killing.\nIn words that now sound prescient, Holder described to reporters that day how "something that was reckless, that was negligent does not meet that standard."\n"We have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with requisite state of mind," he said.\nZimmerman\'s acquittal of state murder and manslaughter charges on Saturday showed the Florida jury rejected that he intended to kill Martin for any reason, including the racial motivation necessary for federal charges that he violated Martin\'s civil rights.\nThe Department of Justice opened an investigation into the Zimmerman case last year, and a statement from the agency on Sunday said it was ongoing and will now include evidence and testimony from the Florida trial.\nIn a speech in Washington on Monday, Holder said the Justice Department would "continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law" in examining what he called "the tragic, unnecessary shooting death of Trayvon Martin."\n"Independent of the legal determination that will be made, I believe that this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised," Holder said. "We must not - as we have too often in the past - let this opportunity pass."\nSeparately, the White House said President Barack Obama would play no role in deciding whether federal charges are filed.\n"Cases are brought on the merits and the merits are evaluated by the professionals at the Department of Justice," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters.\nThe president on Sunday called Martin\'s killing a tragedy for America, but said in a written statement that the jury had spoken. He acknowledged the case had "elicited strong passions," but urged "calm reflection."\nDemonstrators around the country are calling for Zimmerman to be punished, and hundreds of thousands of people have signed online petitions by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) that call for federal charges.\nHowever, legal experts make the same point Holder did last year in saying the law limits the federal government\'s options.\nBecause Zimmerman is a private citizen, he can only be charged with a hate crime in terms of civil rights violations under federal law, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Florida who now is in private practice.\nTo successfully prosecute Zimmerman, the Department of Justice would have to show that Zimmerman "caused the death of Trayvon Martin solely motivated by/because of his race or color," Weinstein told CNN in an e-mail, adding: "This element was absent from the state trial and quite frankly doesn\'t exist."\nCNN Legal analyst Paul Callan agreed Monday that federal prosecutors are "in sort of a tough spot." The hate crimes statue is generally applied to cases involving police officers or other government agents, Callan said, adding that using it in a case involving a lone private citizen is "very, very rare and I think in this case, it\'s going to be very hard to prove."\nA federal hate crimes violation in a killing carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. Even if the federal charges were identical to the state charges, it would not be double jeopardy for Zimmerman because the federal government is a separate and sovereign entity.\nThose seeking federal charges say the killing was racially motivated, arguing that Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, targeted Martin for special scrutiny because the teenager was an African-American. Regardless of how the shooting occurred, they say, the fight occurred because of Martin\'s race.\n"The most fundamental of civil rights — the right to life — was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin," says the petition on the NAACP website.\nRep. Marcia Fudge, the Ohio Democrat who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said racial profiling like what Zimmerman did to Martin "continues to make communities of innocent individuals fear a justice system designed to protect them."\n"Men and women wonder if merely walking or driving justifies being followed, stopped, or questioned," Fudge said in a statement Monday. "This practice and the presumption of guilt so often associated with people of color must come to an end."\nA crush of petitioners crashed the NAACP website during the night, causing the group to set up a parallel petition drive on the liberal MoveOn.org website, said Derek Turner of the NAACP. A separate petition effort on the White House website generated nearly 15,000 supporters.\nSuch political pressure evokes memories of the Rodney King case in 1991, when videotape of white Los Angeles police officers clubbing an African-American man after a car chase prompted race-tinged national furor.\nWhen a criminal court failed to convict the officers of police brutality, riots ensued in Los Angeles over alleged racial discrimination.\nThe Justice Department then filed a civil rights suit against the officers, alleging "deprivations of federal rights under color of law," and two were convicted in 1993. A court sentenced them to 30 months in federal prison.\nWeinstein said the Justice Department can\'t file similar charges against Zimmerman because he is a private citizen instead of a police officer or government official of any kind.\n"There are no other relevant sections under which to prosecute him" other than the hate crime statute, which covers "offenses involving actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national origin," Weinstein added.\nHowever, Martin\'s family can still file a civil wrongful death lawsuit against Zimmerman to seek penalties and damages. Such a legal move carries no criminal penalty or prison time.

Well this is awkward.\nIf you missed Barack Obama's impromptu speech last Friday on the realities of growing up black in the same country as Trayvon Martin, this is the passage that's most essential for understanding why New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly would make a baffling choice to become the country's top domestic security official:\nYou know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African-American community at least, there’s a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it’s important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that -- that doesn’t go away.\nThere are very few African-American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.\nAnd there are very few African-American men who haven’t had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me, at least before I was a senator. There are very few African-Americans who haven’t had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often.\nMORE FROM THE ATLANTIC CITIES\nStop-and-frisk, the deeply controversial policing tactic that Kelly has led and defended in New York City, is essentially the institutional version of everything that Obama describes above. The only difference is that the people following blacks in New York, eying them with distrust and suspecting them of being up to no good, are police officers. And they have the power to pat people down and detain them, one indignity piled onto another.

On Monday, in response to my piece on 17-year-old Darryl Green of Chicago, who was found shot to death after refusing to join a gang at school, Jamelle Bouie of claimed that “black-on-black crime” is a myth. “There’s no such as ‘black-on-black’ crime. Yes, from 1976 to 2005, 94 percent of black victims were killed by black offenders, but that for white victims of violent crime–86 percent were killed by white offenders. Indeed, for the large majority of crimes, you’ll find that victims and offenders share a racial identity, or have some prior relationship to each other,” wrote Bouie. Bouie added, “Nor are African-Americans especially criminal. If they were, you would still see high rates of crime among blacks, even as the nation sees a historic decline in criminal offenses. Instead, crime rates among African-Americans, and black youth in particular, have taken a sharp drop.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Calls for the Justice Department to look into the shooting death of Trayvon Martin reverberated as soon as George Zimmerman was acquitted of state charges in a Florida courtroom, but it may be even tougher to mount a federal case against Zimmerman.\nThe department says it\'s reviewing evidence to determine whether criminal civil rights charges are warranted, but legal experts see major barriers to a federal prosecution — including the burden of proving that Zimmerman, the former neighborhood watch leader, was motivated by racial animosity — and say Justice officials would likely be saddled with some of the same challenges that complicated the unsuccessful state case.\n"The Justice Department would face significant challenges in bringing a federal civil rights case against Mr. Zimmerman," said Alan Vinegrad, the former U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York. "There are several factual and legal hurdles that federal prosecutors would have to overcome: They\'d have to show not only that the attack was unjustified, but that Mr. Zimmerman attacked Mr. Martin because of his race and because he was using a public facility, the street."\nThe department opened an investigation into Martin\'s death last year but stepped aside to allow the state prosecution to proceed. It said in a statement Sunday that the criminal section of its civil rights division, the FBI and federal prosecutors in Florida are continuing to evaluate the evidence generated during the federal investigation, plus evidence and testimony from the state trial. The statement came as the NAACP and others called on the Justice Department to open a civil rights case against Zimmerman for the shooting death of the unarmed black 17-year-old.\nZimmerman was acquitted Saturday night in a February 2012 shooting that tapped into a national debate about racial profiling, equal justice and self-defense. Civil rights leaders, Martin\'s parents and many others said Zimmerman had racially profiled Martin when he followed the teenager through a gated townhouse community and shot him, but Zimmerman said he was physically assaulted by Martin and shot the teenager in self-defense.

The mothers of both Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman testified Friday it was their own son\'s voice calling for help on a taped 911 call in a dramatic day of testimony that saw the prosecution rest and the defense begin its case in Zimmerman\'s murder trial.\nAfter Judge Debra Nelson ruled against a defense motion for acquittal late Friday afternoon, the prosecution announced it was resting and the defense began by calling Zimmerman\'s mother, Gladys.\nShe testified the voice heard screaming for help on the 911 call was her son\'s and she knew it was him "because he\'s my son." The recording was made during a fight between Zimmerman and Martin minutes before the neighborhood watch volunteer shot the teen.\nZimmerman\'s uncle, Jorge Meza, a deputy with the Orange County Sheriff\'s Office, then testified that he overheard the 911 screams while watching television and, " It was Jorge screaming for his life."\nCourt was then recessed until Monday morning.\nEarlier Friday, Sybrina Fulton, Martin\'s mother, testified that her 17-year-old son could clearly be heard on the tape recorded Feb. 26, 2012.\n[pullquote]\nAfter the 911 audio was played, prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda asked Fulton, "Who do you recognize that to be?"\n"Trayvon Benjamin Martin," she replied.\nDefense attorney Mark O\'Mara suggested during cross-examination that Fulton may have been influenced by others who listened to the 911 call, including relatives and her former husband.\nO\'Mara also asked Fulton hypothetically whether she would have to accept it was Zimmerman yelling for help if the screams did not come from her son. O\'Mara also asked if she hoped Martin didn\'t do anything that led to his death.\n"I heard my son screaming," Fulton said. "I would hope for this to never have happened and he would still be here."\nEarlier Friday, Fulton posted on Twitter: "I pray that God give me the strength to properly represent my angel Trayvon."\nTrayvon\'s brother, Jahvaris Fulton, 22, also testified Friday that he recognized Trayvon\'s voice on the 911 calls.\nO\'Mara then asked Trayvon\'s older brother why last year he had told a reporter that he wasn\'t sure if the voice belonged to Martin.\n"I didn\'t want to believe it was him," Jahvaris Fulton testified.\nZimmerman’s father, in contrast, has said the screams were from his son rather than Martin. The screams are considered to be crucial pieces of evidence because they could determine who was the aggressor in the confrontation. An FBI expert testified earlier in the week that a person familiar with a voice is in the best position to identify it.\nShiping Bao, who performed Martin’s autopsy a day after he was killed, testified that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the chest. The manner of death was a homicide, he said.\nBao testified that Martin was in pain and suffered for up to 10 minutes after being shot by Zimmerman. The fatal bullet went from the front to the back of the teen\'s chest, piercing his heart.\n"There was no chance he could survive," Bao testified.\nUnder questioning by defense attorney Don West following Friday’s lunch recess, Bao said he changed his opinion regarding the length of time Martin lived after being shot from his original estimate during a deposition he gave in November of 1 to 3 minutes to up to 10 minutes. He changed his opinion following another autopsy roughly three weeks ago that was “very similar” to that of Martin’s, Bao testified.\nBao also testified that the marijuana found in Martin’s system coul have had no effect or some effect in the confrontation with Zimmerman.\nWhen asked if Martin would be able to move his arms or hands after being shot, Bao responded that “only one person in this court knows.”\nOn Wednesday, an expert witness testified that none of Zimmerman\'s DNA was found under the fingernails of Martin, despite defense attempts to portray Zimmerman as only firing his gun in self-defense.\nCrime lab analyst Anthony Gorgone also testified that two different DNA profiles were found on the pistol grip. One was Zimmerman\'s but the other could not be identified. However, Gorgone said he was able to determine that it did not match Martin\'s DNA sequence.\nProsecutors spent most of Wednesday\'s proceedings painting Zimmerman as a police wannabe, amid testimony that featured technological glitches, forensic evidence and a prosecution witness who greeted Zimmerman from the stand.\nZimmerman faces life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. The state argued during its opening statement that Zimmerman profiled and followed Martin in his truck and called a police dispatch number before he and the teen got into a fight.\nFox News\' Joshua Rhett Miller, Perry Chiaramonte, Serafin Gomez and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Trayvon Martin\'s father told a crowded Capitol Hill forum on Wednesday that "a statute or amendment" safeguarding young people against the type of circumstances that resulted in his son\'s death would be a fitting legacy for his son.\n"The question is, what can we do as parents, what can we do as African-American men, to assure our kids that you don\'t have to be afraid to walk outside your house?" Tracy Martin asked during a forum convened by the Congressional Caucus on Black Men and Boys, one of several such caucuses comprised of House members who want to seek possible legislative responses on various issues.\nMartin said he is dedicated to ensuring that depictions during the trial of George Zimmerman, the man who shot Trayvon dead but was acquitted, do not define his 17-year-old son. Trayvon was his hero, Martin said, and "to not be there in his time of need is real troublesome, not to be able to save my son\'s life."\nMartin\'s comments opened what was billed as the first gathering of the caucus, which was formed to focus attention on issues disproportionately affecting black men and boys, such as joblessness and racial profiling.\n"I would like to see Trayvon Martin\'s name attached to a statute or amendment that says you can\'t just profile our children, shoot them ... and say you were defending yourself," Tracy Martin told the lawmakers and the standing-room-only crowd.\n"With everything that I have left in me, we will make sure his name will not be dragged through the mud," Martin said.\nThe mostly black audience gave Martin a standing ovation as former NAACP President Kweisi Mfume, a former congressman who has six sons and four grandsons, praised Martin for the grace and dignity he has displayed in his grief. Martin remained seated and twirled a pen in his hands, appearing almost embarrassed by the adulation.\nMfume cited the cases of Emmitt Till, a 14-year-old boy killed in Mississippi in 1955, and Rodney King, whose 1991 beating by Los Angeles police was captured on video, as examples of a sad, cyclical history that have had an impact on black men and boys.\n"We cannot keep revisiting this. We cannot and we ought not," Mfume said.\nMartin\'s appearance came a few days after President Barack Obama made remarks identifying himself with the plight of the Florida teenager who was shot and killed last year during a confrontation with Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer.\nZimmerman, 29, said he fired the deadly shot at the unarmed boy in self-defense, and he was acquitted July 13 of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. The verdict sparked protests and calls for federal officials to charge Zimmerman with violating Trayvon Martin\'s civil rights. Federal officials are reviewing the case.\nDiscussion and solutions during the forum included ensuring that high-quality preschools are available to black children, changing minimum drug sentencing laws, and pursuing federal pre-emption of Florida\'s Stand Your Ground law, which some have cited as justification for Zimmerman\'s action.\nEleanor Holmes Norton, the congressional delegate for Washington, D.C., called stand-your-ground laws "a clear and present danger" to all black males. After the hearing, she said lawmakers are concerned that Martin\'s case would fade from prominence over time, and "we will go on to the next kid" to be hurt or killed in a stand-your-ground situation.\n"We owe it to the Martin family to try to get rid of that law," she said.\nRep. Danny Davis, D-Ill., co-chair of the new caucus, said the aim of the coalition is to highlight issues that impact and influence the conditions of black males. For example, he said, there are few male African-American teachers in elementary and primary school, so some black boys never see someone who looks like them involved in education and thus grow up perceiving education as something women do.\nThe unemployment rate for black men aged 20 and over was 13 percent in June compared to 6.2 percent for white men in that age bracket. The unemployment rate for black males and females 16 to 19 years old was 43.6 percent last month, compared to 20.4 percent for whites, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nAlso speaking were David Johns, executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African-Americans, and Georgetown University sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson.\nLater this week, members of the Congressional Black Caucus were to convene a summit in Chicago to consider solutions to the issue of urban gun violence.

We would like to stress that the verdict was reached fairly and justly and that it reflects the letter of the law and represents the law’s proper application to the facts. While we acknowledge the racial context of the case, we hope that the President was not suggesting that this case fits a pattern of racial disparity, because we strongly contend that it does not.\n"This case has given the nation an opportunity to have a candid conversation about race. We would like to contribute to this discourse. Our President has clearly indicated he is willing to contribute to the discourse. As we begin this conversation, we want to say this: we cannot talk about race in sound bites. Before you cast an opinion about what the President said, be sure to listen to his comments in full. Before you judge George Zimmerman or disparage the verdict of the citizen jury, understand the facts in full. Agree not to listen to just what meets your predisposition, but to accept what exists.\n"Only in this way can we assure that the conversations we want to have, that we need to have, will be attended and listened to by those whose presence is necessary for a full discourse -- a discourse that can have positive consequences for our growth as a nation."

A jury in Florida acquitted Zimmerman of all charges related to the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. View photos of key moments from the trial.\nWe have a Department of Justice, not a Department of Social Justice. That is an essential distinction. It is brought into sharp relief by politicized demands that George Zimmerman, having just been acquitted of murder by the state of Florida, be subjected to a second prosecution -- a federal civil rights indictment -- over the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.\nThe Justice Department has earned the trust of the United States courts precisely because it resists the politicization of law enforcement. Its tradition is to ensure the equal protection of law for every American, to evaluate cases strictly on the basis of facts and law, and to recognize its obligations not only to the community but also to criminal suspects.\nYet, though Attorney General Eric Holder never tires of reminding us about the due process owed even to foreign terrorists who\'ve confessed to mass murder, the principle does not seem to apply to Zimmerman, an American now acquitted of murder.\nEven if the Justice Department never files criminal charges against Zimmerman -- which is likely given the implausibility of obtaining a conviction -- it is extremely inappropriate for law enforcement officials, particularly the U.S. attorney general, to engage in a running extrajudicial commentary that taints the jury pool and ratchets up the investigative anxiety for a citizen who is presumed innocent and has been acquitted. Law enforcement officials speak in court -- with public charges, if prosecutors have the evidence to back them up.\nThe justice system is not a morality play. It is not designed to right every wrong, nor has it the capacity to remediate tragedy, such as the indescribable pain the Martin family endures after the loss of their 17-year-old son. In the face of such tragedy, the human instinct to demand some kind of "justice" -- social, poetic or cosmic -- is something we all feel. But that is not the justice our legal system exists to dispense.\nFederal courts prosaically apply established law to provable facts, and they rely heavily on the Justice Department to perform that duty faithfully. When a popular political narrative -- such as the left\'s portrayal of racism as the root cause of many American ills -- crashes into uncongenial facts, the justice system is the place where the narrative must yield, and the Justice Department is supposed to ensure that it does.\nSadly, just the opposite has happened in the Zimmerman case. It has been bereft from the start both of proof that Zimmerman had the requisite criminal intent to sustain a murder charge and of evidence to refute his well-corroborated claim of self-defense. That is why veteran police investigators initially declined to file charges.\nAttending an anti-Zimmerman rally with Sharpton, Holder saber-rattled about filing a civil rights case. As the attorney general well knew, his inappropriate chatter would be construed as a suggestion that Florida had abdicated its responsibilities by declining to prosecute a purportedly racist murderer. Simultaneously, Justice\'s Community Relations Service worked closely with anti-Zimmerman activists to pressure Florida Gov. Rick Scott into reversing the police determination that there was no case. Scott finally caved, appointing the compliant special prosecutor Angela Corey, who dutifully lodged a groundless second-degree murder charge.\nStandard, prudent Justice Department practice has always discouraged commentary on criminal investigations outside the public record. That is for the politicians. Law enforcement is not supposed to speak until the government is ready to file public charges and back them up in court.\nTo the contrary, Holder has engaged in an extrajudicial publicity campaign, and now finds himself in the hot seat: It\'s been over a year since he promised to file charges if warranted by the facts, and the facts have long been known -- indeed, they\'ve been tried in court.\nObviously, it is easier to promise to keep investigating -- and to keep alive a race narrative dear to President Obama\'s political base -- than to acknowledge that there is no federal case against Zimmerman. The insurmountable proof problems Florida prosecutors faced do not even begin to describe the challenges that would confront a federal case.\nA civil rights case would require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman shot Martin out of racial animus. There is no evidence that Zimmerman has ever been a racist -- jurors in the Florida case say race was not relevant to the case, and the FBI, after investigating extensively for months, has been unable to find proof of a racial motivation.\nFurthermore, a federal prosecution would require proof that Zimmerman was trying to prevent Martin\'s enjoyment of some statutorily specified civil right -- like attending school, applying for a job, staying in a hotel, going to a restaurant, or participating in a federal program. The Zimmerman-Martin altercation was purely local with no federal implications.\nFinally, in light of the Justice Department\'s heavy-handed role in pressuring Florida to bring a case that police originally decided not to charge, there may be a serious question whether the "dual sovereignty" exception to double jeopardy -- allowing a federal prosecution despite a state acquittal -- applies.\nThis is not a federal case. If real justice had been served, it would never have been a criminal case at all.

SANFORD, Florida (Reuters) - President Barack Obama called for calm on Sunday after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, as thousands of civil rights demonstrators turned out at rallies to condemn racial profiling.\nZimmerman, cleared late on Saturday by a Florida jury of six women, still faces public outrage, a possible civil suit and demands for a federal investigation.\nWith civil rights activists clamoring for federal civil rights charges, the U.S. Justice Department said it was evaluating whether it has enough evidence to support prosecution of Zimmerman in federal court after his acquittal in Florida.\nZimmerman’s lawyers argued he acted in self-defense the night of February 26, 2012, when, they say, Martin attacked Zimmerman inside a gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford. They accuse civil rights advocates of wrongly injecting the issue of race.\n“It was such a shame. The whole case nearly destroyed George from day one ... . That they put a racism spin on this prosecution just hurt him very deeply,” said John Donnelly, a close friend of Zimmerman who testified in the trial.\nCritics contend Zimmerman, 29, who is white and Hispanic, wrongly suspected Martin, 17, of being a criminal because he was black. Zimmerman called police to report a suspicious looking person, then left his car with a fully loaded Kel Tec 9mm pistol concealed in his waistband.\nA fight ensued in which Zimmerman suffered a bloody nose and head injuries, and Zimmerman shot Martin once in the heart.\nThe teenager had no criminal record and was staying in the neighborhood at the home of his father’s fiancee. He had been walking back from a convenience store where he had bought candy and a soft drink.\nThousands of protesters chanting “No justice, no peace” gathered in New York City on Sunday to protest the acquittal, which prompted rallies across the country.\n“I feel if we don’t step it up, we’re in trouble,” said Prince Akeem, 20, of the Bronx. “It’s young blacks being targeted and we have to stand up, stand up to the cops.”\nHundreds of activists demand justice for Trayvon Martin after marching to Times Square from New York's Union Square July 14, 2013. REUTERS/Adrees Latif\nAbout 1,000 to 2,000 of the demonstrators abandoned the protest site at Union Square to march in the streets toward Times Square, slowing or stopping traffic. Police attempted to funnel the crowd into controlled lanes but were unable to.\nPolice attempted to halt the march about eight blocks short of Times Square, which was already packed with tourists, but the demonstrators made their way around the officers.\nPROTESTS AROUND COUNTRY\nSaturday’s not-guilty verdict was decried by civil rights leaders and protests were organized in several cities, including Boston, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento.\nIn Boston, about 500 racially mixed protesters left their demonstration site in the Roxbury neighborhood and started marching in the streets alongside police escorts on motorcycle and on foot. “They’ve been very orderly,” Boston police superintendent William Evans said.\nAround Sanford, some residents expressed relief at the verdict, while others said they failed to see how Zimmerman could have been acquitted.\n“You said he’s not guilty, but why would you say he’s not guilty?” 28-year-old Robyn Miller said. “It’s crazy.”\nObama, who once said, “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon,” called for a peaceful response to a case that polarized the U.S. public from the beginning, raising issues of racial profiling and gun control.\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n“We are a nation of laws and a jury has spoken,” the first black U.S. president said in a statement. “I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.”\nThe jurors who deliberated for 16 hours over two days found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. All six women, who were sequestered for the three weeks of testimony, declined to speak to reporters and their identities were still sealed by the court.\nHURT AND SAD IN SANFORD\nIf found guilty of the most serious charge of second-degree murder, Zimmerman could have faced life in prison. Instead, the jury cleared him of that charge and of manslaughter, which could have resulted in a 30-year sentence.\nIn Sanford at the largely black Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church, pastor Valarie Houston dedicated a Sunday morning prayer service to Martin.\n“I am hurt. I am sad. I am disappointed and my heart is overwhelmed with pains,” Houston said. “I thought in my heart that justice would be served.”\nZimmerman, who showed little reaction when the decision was read, was unshackled from a monitoring device he had been wearing while on bail. He previously only left home in a disguise and body armor, his lawyer said.\nHis brother said he would remain out of public view for some time. Friends said the former neighborhood watch volunteer had recently spoken about the possibility of entering law school.\nThe tense drama that climaxed with the verdict had been building for more than a year, since police initially declined to arrest Zimmerman for shooting Martin, whose gray hooded sweatshirt has become a symbol of injustice for protesters.\nThe acquittal will weaken any wrongful death civil lawsuit that Martin’s family might bring. Zimmerman’s lead defense lawyer, Mark O’Mara, predicted Zimmerman would seek and win immunity from a civil suit.\nA Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday it would determine whether “the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction.”\nAdditional reporting by Irene Klotz in Sanford, Chris Francescani, Adrees Latif and Victoria Cavalieri in New York, Ross Kerber in Boston, Mark Felsenthal and Paul Simao in Washington; Writing by Paul Thomasch and Daniel Trotta; Editing by Xavier Briand and Stacey Joyce

sages that came from Martin\'s cellphone. An attorney for a technology worker in the State Attorney\'s Office testified that he first brought the evidence to the attention of Zimmerman\'s attorneys after he was contacted by the technology worker.</p>\n<p>The judge decided to suspend further testimony on sanctions, and any decision, until after the trial.</p>', 'text': 'SANFORD, Fla. – A Florida judge denied a defense request Thursday to let a handful of witnesses testify confidentially during George Zimmerman\'s trial for fatally shooting Trayvon Martin.\nDefense attorney Mark O\'Mara asked that the witnesses be allowed to testify out of the public eye because of concerns for their safety about testifying at the trial, which starts next week. He said their testimony could impact the jury\'s decision.\nProsecutors and attorneys for media groups objected to the request.\nCircuit Judge Debra Nelson also heard testimony about whether a voice recognition expert will be allowed to testify at the trial. Cries for help can be heard in the background of 911 calls that Zimmerman\'s neighbors made during a struggle between the neighborhood watch volunteer and Martin before the unarmed teen was shot. Experts have reached mixed conclusions about whose voice is crying for help.\nFBI voice expert Hirotaka Nakasone, who was testifying for the defense, said there wasn\'t enough clear sound on the 911 recording to determine whose voice it was. He also said the concept that individuals have unique voice-prints that could identify them was misleading.\n"No one can speak in the same way twice," Nakasone said.\nTestimony was to continue Friday and the judge didn\'t issue a ruling.\nZimmerman has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, claiming self-defense, in the racially charged case. A delay in Zimmerman\'s arrest led to protests nationwide. Martin was black. Zimmerman\'s father is white, and his mother is Hispanic.\nThe trial is expected to last more than a month.\nThe judge also considered a request from defense attorneys to sanction prosecutors for what the defense said amounts to withholding evidence. Zimmerman\'s attorneys alleged that prosecutors withheld deleted photos and text messages that came from Martin\'s cellphone. An attorney for a technology worker in the State Attorney\'s Office testified that he first brought the evidence to the attention of Zimmerman\'s attorneys after he was contacted by the technology worker.\nThe judge decided to suspend further testimony on sanctions, and any decision, until after the trial.

As debate begins this week on sweeping firearms legislation, supporters are running into renewed concern from conservatives that the bill could lead to a gun "registry" despite adamant pledges to prohibit this.\nFear of a national registry has remained even after two influential senators last week proposed a compromise on background checks. The proposal, which will be voted on as an amendment, would expand background checks to gun shows and Internet sales while exempting personal transactions like those among family members.\nThe provision, meant to ease concerns about the checks becoming too pervasive, also included language to bar the creation of a federal registry.\nBut the language was not enough. Some gun-rights supporters continue to worry about a slippery-slope scenario, where a background check expansion sets the stage for a national registry -- which could then be exploited to seize weapons from individuals. Despite the fact that licensed dealers already keep records of their sales and a national registry has not yet been created, the Second Amendment nightmare scenario has lived on.\n"Once you get these lists out there, once you have a gun dealer keeping lists for lots of other people, the only way that works, frankly I think, is if you keep the paper," Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., told Fox News on Monday. "And if you keep the paper, eventually, somebody\'s going to ask for it."\nConcerns about gun seizures were stoked most recently after a New York gun owner had his weapons mistakenly seized. They were later ordered to be returned.\nSens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., who drafted the background check amendment, insist a registry is expressly prohibited.\nThe language of the proposal says the Justice Department "may not consolidate or centralize the records" on firearms sales or possession. It goes on to say nothing in the proposal would allow the establishment of a "federal firearms registry."\nManchin, speaking on CBS\' "Face the Nation," reiterated that sellers can do a background check and keep a record -- but the proposal would prohibit a national registry, punishing anybody who tries creating one with up to 15 years imprisonment.\nDespite the assurances, some lawmakers were skeptical.\n"It has been said on the floor recently that background check legislation cannot lead to gun registries because federal law prohibits that. But current federal law can be changed," Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said last week, calling recordkeeping a "step toward registration."\nHe cited testimony that gun registration is important to ensuring a system of universal background checks works.\nThose concerns were echoed Monday by Blunt, who said he plans to oppose the bill. He cited reports last week that said 185,000 people in his state were affected after a list of concealed-weapon permit holders was given to federal officials.\nSen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., also said in a statement last week that the Manchin-Toomey proposal "prioritizes collecting records over protecting citizens."\nDavid Addington, with the conservative Heritage Foundation, argued that while the new proposal prohibits a federal registry, it also includes language that could create wiggle room for the Justice Department.\nYet supporters of new gun legislation are slowly peeling off votes in favor of the bill. The Senate voted 68-31 last week to advance to debate, easily clearing the 60-vote threshold.\nThe bill will have to clear that bar once more before earning a final vote -- and some of those who voted "yes" last week could vote "no" the second time around.\nBut over the weekend, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said he was "very favorably disposed" to the Manchin-Toomey amendment.\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., as well as Toomey, have also signaled support from the Republican side.\nDemocrats have a 55-vote majority in the Senate, including two independents who typically caucus with Democrats. If all those Democrats vote for the bill, they would still need five Republicans.\nBut Democrats could lose a handful of their own -- for instance, two Democrats facing reelection next year opposed last week\'s motion -- which would require even more Republican support.\nIt\'s not yet clear whether Democrats can garner enough of it. Another prominent Republican, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., announced Monday that he will oppose the Toomey-Manchin amendment.\n"Instead of expanding a broken background check system, let\'s fix it," he said.

RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A top National Rifle Association official on Tuesday accused President Barack Obama of seeking to redefine the rights of gun owners, telling a hunting and wildlife conservation group that the president\'s use of the word "absolutism" in his inauguration speech was an attack on law-abiding citizens who own firearms.\nObama said in his speech Monday that Americans shouldn\'t "mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate."\nThe remark was interpreted by the NRA as a reference to the organization\'s steadfast opposition to any new gun regulations.\nNRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre told a Weatherby Foundation awards ceremony that the Second Amendment gives Americans the unfettered right to own a firearm, but the president wants to redefine that freedom.\n"Absolutes do exist, words do have specific meaning in language and in law," he said.\nThe president wants Americans to believe that "putting the federal government in the middle of every gun transaction" will make them safer, LaPierre said. But the NRA believes people have the right to defend themselves and their families with semi-automatic firearms technology, he said.\n"No government gave them to us and no government can take them away."\nObama last week unveiled a set of legislative proposals and executive actions on firearms that were formulated in the wake of last month\'s Connecticut school shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead.\nThe NRA responded to the proposals by posting a Web video that labeled Obama an "elitist hypocrite" for allowing his daughters to be protected by armed guards while not embracing a proposal — supported by the NRA — that would place armed guards at all schools. The organization has also planned an aggressive lobbying push to thwart new gun regulations and has been raising money in response to the outcry for new gun laws.\nLaPierre\'s speech on Tuesday was billed as a response to Obama\'s inaugural address.

SACRAMENTO — New sales of semi-automatic rifles with removable magazines would be banned in California under a bill passed by the Democratic-led state legislature on Tuesday, and those who already own such weapons would have to register them.\nThe measure, which passed the state Assembly 44-31 and is expected to go to Governor Jerry Brown for his signature after amendments are approved in the state Senate, is one of a package of gun control bills passed earlier this year by senators in the wake of the massacre last year at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.\nIt would classify as an assault weapon as any rifle that accepts a detachable magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition, and would ban its sale or purchase. People who already own such weapons would be required to register them.\n"How many more innocent men, women and children have to be slaughtered while going about their daily lives before we do something?" asked Assemblyman Reginald B. Jones-Sawyer, Sr., a Democrat from Los Angeles, speaking in favor of the ban.\nHe ticked off a gruesome list of recent gun massacres: Sandy Hook, killings at a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin, the Colorado movie theater killings and others.\nThe road to passage has not been easy for several of the weapons measures introduced this year, despite California\'s history of strong gun control laws and large legislative majorities for Democrats, who tend to favor them.\nNew voting laws in the state have made it necessary for many Democrats - particularly in the Assembly - to win over moderates and conservatives, and Republicans were joined by several Democrats in opposing the bill.\n"I don\'t know what the right word is to express how strongly I oppose this bill," said Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, a Republican who represents the Southern California community of Twin Peaks, complaining that it amounted to a direct swipe against the constitutional right to bear arms.\nCalifornia, which has some of the toughest gun control laws in the nation, already bans rifles with large-capacity fixed magazines, which cannot be removed. This bill would expand that ban to add rifles that accept large-capacity removable magazines.\nOther bills in the package passed by the Senate would have tightened additional laws, including banning a type of trigger known as a button.\nFaced with reluctance by the more conservative, but still Democratic leaning, state Assembly to take up the package, Assembly Speaker John Perez, himself a gun owner, placed the bills in legislative limbo where they remained for months.\nNow, with the end of the session looming on Thursday, Perez late last week released three of the bills, including the one passed on Tuesday. Six Democrats joined Assembly Republicans to vote in the minority against the measure.\nTwo other bills remain active from the original package, and are expected to be heard later this week.\nOne would ban possession of any ammunition clip that holds more than 10 rounds, and the other bans people with multiple drug and alcohol convictions and convictions for gang-related crimes from owning a firearm for 10 years.\nPopular Discussio

(AP)\nALBANY, N.Y. – A New York state judge agreed Friday to consider whether the state\'s tough new gun restrictions were rushed into law in violation of the state constitution.\nState Supreme Court Justice Gerald Connolly signed an order granting the request for a hearing by plaintiffs who are challenging Gov. Andrew Cuomo\'s decision to waive the three-day review usually required before votes on bills, according to LoHud.com.\nThe plaintiffs argue the law violates the guarantees of free speech, property ownership and the right to petition the government guaranteed under the state and federal constitutions.\nPlaintiff Robert Schulz called Cuomo a "king" for pushing through the nation\'s toughest gun law by suspending the three-day vetting period by submitting a “message of necessity” on the law, which allows the constitutional waiting period to be suspended.\n"Kings govern by opinion," said Shulz, who calls himself a "constitutionalist" and has challenged governors for decades in court although he isn\'t a lawyer. "There has to be some rationale, some justification of facts before waiving the people\'s demand for three days"\' review of a bill.\nThe law enacted Jan. 15, pushed by Cuomo, sets a seven-bullet limit on magazines, tightens the definition of illegal "assault weapons" and requires owners of formerly legal semi-automatic guns to register them, among other measures.\nThe New Yorkers are representing themselves, without lawyers. A March 11 date in state court is scheduled. State officials will have to argue their case to avoid an injunction against the law.\n"We believe the law is, and the process was, valid and constitutional," said Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi.\nCuomo and legislative leaders agreed on the bill in closed-door negotiations and put the politically dicey measure to a vote at night in mid-January. That was after Cuomo issued the message of necessity, which the plaintiffs say includes misrepresentations.\nThe message of necessity, according to LoHud.com, reads: “Some weapons are so dangerous, and some ammunition devices are so lethal, that New York State must act without delay to prohibit their continued sale and possession in the state in order to protect its children, first responders and citizens as soon as possible. This bill, if enacted, would do so by immediately banning the ownership, purchase and sale of assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices.”\nSchulz, of Warren County, called the gun control law "repugnant" and seeks to have it declared void. The plaintiffs said they have 1,200 backers.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Schumer has been fighting to get his Protecting Responsible Gun Sellers Act of 2013 ()–now called the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2013–passed into law, but one of the early problems with the bill was that it was essentially a shell or placeholder bill, incomplete at the time of introduction.

Breitbart News reported to the 2006 story of Martin Lee Anderson. Attorney Crump said publicly that he was following the same media ‘playbook’ as the Anderson case. Tactics included using a photo of Anderson as a child, the same way the media used the Crump-supplied photo of Trayvon Martin as child. This story from 2006 shows the involvement of Senator Obama (who did not end up appearing at the rally), Sharpton and Jackson as well as other usual suspects from the far left.\nA rally will be taking place in Tallahassee Friday, April 21 regarding the ongoing investigation into the death of 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson. Anderson died Jan. 6 at a Panhandle boot camp after being kneed and punched by Bay County Sheriff’s boot camp guards.\nStudents from Florida State University, Tallahassee Community College and Florida A&M University have been involved in the planning and organization of the event at which Rev. Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton will be making appearances.\nCharlie and Martin Sheen, who donated $10,000 to the cause, are also reportedly planning to attend Friday, along with former TLC member Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins and Afeni Shakur, mother of the murdered rapper Tupac Shakur. According Samantha Greer, an FSU student and volunteer for the Coalition for Justice for Martin Lee Anderson, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois may also make an appearance. Greer stressed that the Coalition is still looking for volunteers and that anyone is welcome to join the cause.\nWhat we saw in 2012 was the Obama administration using taxpayer resources to ratchet up racial tensions in a local crime case and literally creating key story points in the narrative, such as forcing the sheriff to temporarily resign. At the same time, the President himself made an emotional statement about the victim with direct reference to his race, without revealing that he had worked with the victim’s attorney a few years earlier in a similar case. At the same time, Obama media ally (and Sharpton employer) NBC outrageously edited the Zimmerman audio to make Zimmerman appear racist. All these manipulative and deceptive uses of the race card–pushed along by the Holder DOJ at taxpayer expense–happened just months before the 2012 presidential election.\nThe only reason this isn’t a major scandal already is the media hasn’t ever done its job and declared it one.

The problem with this is that those who wrote the law don’t understand firearms or magazines. And many of the most popular firearms have magazines with removal floorplates — for instance, a Glock magazine. This law will effectively ban certain magazines even if they’re under the capacity limit, based solely on the fact that they are expandable or .

President Barack Obama is "determined" to curb gun violence, US Vice-President Joe Biden has said, opening high-profile talks on the issue.\nMr Biden, leading the White House effort on gun control policy, said the president could use executive orders.\nHe spoke as New York Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.\nThe gun-control moves follow last month\'s deadly shooting in Connecticut that left 28 people dead.\nAdam Lanza killed 20 schoolchildren and six adults at a primary school in Newtown after first shooting his mother dead, then took his own life.\nMr Biden said the president was "determined to take action" to reduce gun violence.\n\'President will act\'\n"We are not going to get caught up in the notion that unless we do everything we\'re going to do nothing," Mr Biden told reporters before the meetings with gun-safety and victims\' groups began.\n"There is a pretty wide consensus on three or four or five things in the gun safety area that could and should be done."\nBut gun control is a polarising issue in Congress, and Mr Biden warned that Mr Obama would take action independently if necessary, although he gave no specific details.\n"We\'re reaching out to all parties on whatever side of this debate you fall," Mr Biden said. "But the president is going to act. There are executive orders, executive action that can be taken."\nThe White House has pledged to send its proposals to Congress at the end of January, shortly after Mr Obama is sworn into office on 21 January for his second term.\nBut an assortment of gun-rights groups are planning a Gun Appreciation Day over the inauguration weekend.\nThey are encouraging gun enthusiasts to visit gun shops, gun ranges and gun shows.\nNRA and Walmart\nIn his remarks, Mr Biden suggested that the White House would consider a range of measures.\nThe BBC\'s Paul Adams, in Washington, reports that they would almost certainly include reinstating a ban on so-called assault weapons, as well as a more comprehensive system of background checks on people buying guns.\nAlso on Wednesday, Mr Cuomo, whose state has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, came out in favour of a ban on assault weapons and on high-capacity ammunition magazines.\n"Some weapons are so dangerous and some ammunition devices so lethal that we simply cannot afford to continue selling them in our state," he said during his State of the State speech.\nMr Cuomo also called for follow-up checks for people with handgun licences, to make sure they are still qualified to own their weapon, and longer sentences for gun crimes.\nHe has been joined by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who called on policy-makers to examine the US mental health system and broaden access to drug treatment.\nMr Christie also said the impact of violent video games should be examined.\nOn Thursday, the vice-president is scheduled to meet the National Rifle Association, the powerful pro-gun group.\nIn the wake of the Connecticut school shooting, the NRA advocated having armed guards at every US school.\nMr Biden will also meet representatives of Walmart, the world\'s largest retailer and the biggest-seller of guns in the US.\nWalmart had initially declined to send anyone to the White House, but a spokesman told Reuters news agency the retailer had "underestimated the expectation to attend the meeting".\nIn California on Wednesday, the nation\'s largest teacher pension fund took the first step to divest from companies that manufacture guns and ammunition.\nCalSTRS\' investment in companies like Sturm, Ruger & Co and Smith & Wesson Holding Corp account for $11.7m (£7.3m) of the system\'s $155bn portfolio.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Residents in a small Rhode Island town are voting Saturday on whether four town council members should be recalled for proposing a change in the way the town issues gun permits.\nSign up for membership to become a founding member and help shape HuffPost’s next chapter\nThe rare recall election was prompted by gun rights supporters who said the four Exeter council members ignored their objections to a failed proposal to allow the attorney general to oversee the town’s concealed weapons permits.\nBoth sides were concerned about low-turnout with snow in the forecast.\nThe four council members supported a resolution asking the state’s General Assembly to allow the state attorney general to process concealed weapons permits. Under current law, those seeking a permit may apply to either the attorney general or their local police. Since Exeter doesn’t have a police department — just a single town sergeant — the job now falls to the town clerk, who the council members said lacks the resources to conduct proper background checks.\nEven though the council’s request never got a vote in the Assembly, gun rights supporters began petitioning for a recall, saying the town’s leaders had ignored the concerns of hundreds of people who turned out for a meeting on the proposal.\nDebates about gun policy have sparked similar ouster efforts elsewhere. In September, two Democratic Colorado state senators were recalled over their support for changes to gun laws following the theater massacre outside Denver in 2012.\nThe recall vote coincidentally comes on the anniversary of the Newtown, Conn., school shooting.\nThe four officials being targeted by the recall effort are Council President Arlene Hicks and Councilmen Cal Ellis, Robert Johnson and William Monahan. All are Democrats. A fifth member is not up for recall: independent Councilman Raymond Morrissey Jr., who voted against the resolution.\nShould one or more of the council members be recalled, their council seats will go to the losing candidates from the last election. Daniel W. Patterson would get the first seat, Edward F. Nataly the second and Lincoln P. Picillo the third.\nThe fourth seat would be filled by a council appointment.\nPolls close at 8 p.m.

TALLAHASSEE, Florida (Reuters) - Every night for the last three weeks about 50 young protesters have slept on the stone floor of Florida’s state Capitol building in a bid to change the state’s Stand Your Ground self-defense law.\nCalling themselves “Dream Defenders”, and inspired by the 1960s African-American civil rights movement, the protesters want to change a law they blame for the acquittal this month of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.\nTheir nights of sleeping in blankets and living off fast food are unlikely to lead to a repeal or major reform of Stand Your Ground, political analysts say.\nSuch a move is virtually out of the question in Florida’s Republican-dominated legislature, according to analysts.\n“Gun rights are big, especially with the blue dog Democrats that Republicans need in Florida,” said Lance deHaven-Smith, a political scientist at Florida State University. “This law is not repealable. Certainly not by the present legislature.”\n“RETURN TO THE WILD WEST”\nThe Zimmerman case sparked a debate on Stand Your Ground legislation that in 2005 amended the statute governing Florida’s self-defense law. The amendment allows a person in fear of serious injury to use deadly force to defend themselves rather than retreat. Jurors in Florida said the law left them no option but to acquit Zimmerman for the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager.\nMartin’s grieving parents, backed by African-American civic leaders, students and politicians, including Attorney General Eric Holder and President Barack Obama, all say the Stand Your Ground law needs to be re-examined.\n“By allowing — and perhaps encouraging — violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety,” Holder told the convention of the NAACP earlier this month.\nSome, including civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and singer Stevie Wonder, have gone further, calling for a boycott of Florida until the law is repealed.\nFlorida’s self-defense law and the Zimmerman case are seen by many African Americans as emblematic of a lack of racial equality in the U.S. justice system. According to a study by the Tampa Bay Times, legal defense claims under Stand Your Ground were more likely to be successful when the victim was black.\nSeveral groups, including the Martin family, say they are working on drawing up a Trayvon Martin Law to more narrowly define self-defense in cases that involve racial profiling.\nThe Dream Defenders - who have been joined in their nightly protest by the likes of activist/entertainer Harry Belafonte - say they won’t leave until Florida Governor Rick Scott calls a special legislative session on the Stand Your Ground law.\nScott, a firm supporter of the law, is standing his ground and has rejected their demand after meeting them.\n“This is just one tactic we have, focusing on the governor’s office,” said Phillip Agnew a young union activist from Miami who is the leader of the group. “We are also contacting legislators in their districts.”\nThe National Bar Association, which represents African-American lawyers and judges, threw its weight behind the initiative on Monday and called for Scott to hold a special legislative session to review the Stand Your Ground law.\n“Quite simply. You’ve given a license to kill, to shoot first and ask questions later. It’s a return to the Wild West and Dodge City,” said the association’s president, John Page.\nLAW’S SPONSOR TELLS FEDS “LEAVE US ALONE”\nFlorida became the first state in the country to adopt a Stand Your Ground law when it passed in 2005 with resounding bipartisan approval from Florida legislators, including some leading Democrats who now outspokenly oppose it.\nPolls show the law still enjoys strong support in Florida and at least 21 states have since adopted similar laws, according to the National Council of State Legislatures.\nInspired by an outbreak of looting after a string of Florida hurricanes Florida in 2004, the law was meant to protect law-abiding citizens from prosecution for stopping a violent attack.\nThe law’s leading sponsor says he has no regrets about the legislation despite the public outcry. Dennis Baxley, a conservative Republican state representative and staunch supporter of the National Rifle Association, said recent remarks by the president and Holder questioning the law were misplaced.\n“It’s not a federal issue and they need to leave us alone,” Baxley, 60, told Reuters.\nAdvocates of the law say violent crime has fallen in the state since it was passed. At the same time, justifiable homicides in Florida have climbed to a record 66 cases in 2012 from an annual average of 13 between 2001 and 2005, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\nAfter the Martin shooting, bills were introduced in Florida to repeal or scale-back the self-defense statute, but none even got a committee hearing.\nWhatever happens in the legislature, Stand Your Ground is likely to remain a hot political issue headed into the 2014 electoral season. Democrats and Republicans are likely to make gun control and self-defense core issues, said Susan MacManus, a Tampa political scientist at the University of South Florida.\n“One thing is for sure is that it’s an issue that’s not going to die down soon,” she added.

WaPo:\nThe NRA’s congressional operation is so effective that one of the gun lobby’s most outspoken critics, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), initially signed on as a sponsor of the NRA-supported background check bill. Blumenthal said he had no direct contact with the NRA when he signed on to the measure but had been drawn by the idea of a bipartisan initiative to improve background checks.\nOn Friday, Blumenthal withdrew his support, saying in an interview that he was no longer comfortable with the bill because of “serious unintended consequences” related to provisions governing the mentally ill.\nDon\'t confuse this with what the public wants. That the NRA may win some of this battle doesn\'t mean they win everything everywhere. They fought and lost in CT, NY, MD and CO. But there are plenty of places where they will win, for now.\n“I can’t adequately describe how unwilling the American people are to get involved in another war in the Middle East,” said one representative. “We’re almost unable to respond,” given what the United States has spent in Iraq and Afghanistan, said another. He described intervention proposals as “half-baked” and argued that “the last thing we need is something ineffective.” A third member summed up the public mood this way: “We are not just war-weary, we are war-wary.”\nAnd that\'s a bad thing?\nChina, which has been deeply suspicious of the American desire to reassert itself in Asia, has not protested publicly or privately as the United States has deployed ships and warplanes to the Korean Peninsula. That silence, American officials say, attests to both Beijing’s mounting frustration with the North and the recognition that its reflexive support for Pyongyang could strain its ties with Washington.\nread in tandem with above. While there\'s no appetite for war in Syria, Asia is saber-rattling country.\nJoin us for more pundits and punditry below the fold.\nThe surge of generational change continues in this country, altering the cultural landscape with a speed and intensity that has rarely — if ever — been seen before.\nDavid Rothkopf:\nNorth Korea is dangerously close to crossing a line. Not the line that leads to a missile attack on the United States, but the one that separates being a rogue state from being a parody of a rogue state. Pyongyang\'s bluster is as comical as its nuclear threats are implausible.\nRichard Knox:\nSixteen cases of a new flu around Shanghai have touched off a major effort to determine what kind of threat this new bug might be.\nThe victims range in age from 4 to 87 years old. Six have died. It is a tragedy for them and their families, but is it a global crisis?\nTo understand why so few cases are generating so much concern, the first thing to know is that no flu virus like this one — called H7N9 — has ever been known to infect humans before.\nThat immediately grabs the attention of flu pros. "Since it doesn\'t affect people, people haven\'t developed immunity to it," says Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Welcome to economy.\nElsewhere in the plane — “on the other side of the curtain,” as the first-class and business cabins are referred to — dinners are being served on white linen tablecloths, with actual bone china. Everyone’s got their “amenities kit” — one of those little nylon bags containing slippers, an eyeshade and a toothbrush. And legroom? Tons. While our seat width contracts — on some airlines by nearly eight inches in recent years — the space up front continues to expand: Emirates Airlines now offers, as part of its “first-class private suite,” a private room with minibar, wide-screen TV and “lie-flat bed.”\nThis stark class division should come as no surprise: what’s happening in the clouds mirrors what’s happening on the ground. Statusization — to coin a useful term — is ubiquitous, no matter what your altitude. While you’re in your hospital bed spooning up red Jell-O, a patient in a private suite is enjoying strawberries and cream. On your way to a Chase A.T.M., you notice a silver plaque declaring the existence within of Private Client Services. This man has a box seat at a Yankees game; that man has a skybox. And the skybox isn’t the limit: high overhead, the 1 percent fly first class; the .1 percent fly Netjets; the .01 fly their own planes. Why should it be any different up above from down below? ...\nI learned from a blogger just how close we are to class warfare in the sky. Disgusted by the grubby conditions on his flight, this Robespierre of the unfriendly skies invokes the French Revolution and warns: If you annoy “the salt of the earth enough, the rank and file and what have you, sometimes you wind up beheaded.” Let them eat Pringles.\nThe blogger wasn\'t me, but the misery of flying these days has made me more than willing to take a bus or train when I can.

Chinese hacking of American companies and Russia’s cyberattacks against its neighbors have also caused concern in Washington. ...\nRussia and China appear to have decided that, to better advance their own interests, they need to knock Washington down a peg or two. Neither probably wants to kick off a new cold war, let alone hot conflicts, and their actions in the case of Mr. Snowden show it. China allowed him into Hong Kong, but gently nudged his departure, while Russia, after some provocative rhetoric, seems to have now softened its tone.\nBarry Blechmanbelieves we can afford to cut our nuclear arsenal, and warns against those already trying to distort the president\'s proposal.\nThe State Department repeatedly has said that the United States has no intention of moving alone to lower levels of nuclear weapons. The day before the president’s speech, Secretary of State John F. Kerry telephoned Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) to assure him of that.\nIf any country’s security is threatened by nuclear inferiority, it is Russia. Russia already is below the level of forces specified in the 2010 New START treaty; the United States remains above it. The latest data exchange mandated by the treaty, and verified by on-site inspections, showed that as of March, the Russians had 1,480 operational warheads on 492 long-range missiles and bombers. Meanwhile, the United States maintained 1,654 operational warheads on 792 long-range missiles and bombers.\nThose acting as if President Obama is i acting some kind of drastic, unilateral reduction are serving a cause other than that of national security.\nCarl Hiaasen is one of several pundits who thinks that, in charging George Zimmerman with second-degree murder, the state set the bar too high.\nBased on the trajectory of last week’s testimony, it’s almost inconceivable that Zimmerman will be convicted of second-degree murder – a charge that should never have been filed in the first place.\nThe facts in the killing of Trayvon Martin pointed to manslaughter from the beginning, and even then prosecutors would have had their hands full. They might yet persuade the jury to find Zimmerman guilty of that lesser charge, but it will require a deft change of strategy. ...\nTypically in Florida, a second-degree murder case must have the elements of ill will or spite, a state of mind more easily proven in a fatal bar fight than a chance encounter. Zimmerman had never met Martin, so prosecutors were left to use Zimmerman’s words on the police call as evidence of a general antipathy, if not toward blacks then towards a class of what he perceived as neighborhood “punks.”\nJon Healey looks at efforts to turn Missouri into the state that loves, loves, loves guns.\nWhat is it about guns, healthcare and marijuana that bring out the antebellum nuttiness in state lawmakers?\nMissouri Gov. Jay Nixon vetoed a bill Friday that would have declared virtually every federal gun law invalid and subjected federal agents to state charges for enforcing them. Among other things, the measure would have invalidated federal rules banning the possession of machine guns and silencers, requiring gun dealers to be licensed and mandating a waiting period on gun sales.\nBut the Republican-dominated state legislature passed the measure, House Bill 436, by more than the two-thirds majority required to override the veto. So it may be just a matter of time before Nixon, a Democrat, finds himself leading the state of "Missuzi."\nOnly a few years ago, Missouri residents passed a state-wide mandate against concealed carry. Of course, the conservative legislature just put those concealed weapons right back, Ah, representative government.\nBarack Obama shares an opinion of his own. Needless to say. This is your Read It All offering of the morning.\nI recently unveiled a new national plan to confront climate change. It\'s a plan that will reduce carbon pollution to prevent the worst effects of climate change, prepare our country for the effects we can\'t stop and lead the world in combating the growing threat of a changing climate.\nMany Americans who already feel the effects of climate change don\'t have time to deny it — they\'re busy dealing with it. Firefighters are braving longer wildfire seasons. Farmers are seeing crops wilt one year and wash away the next. Families in the West are worried about water that\'s drying up. And while we know no single weather event is caused solely by climate change, we also know that in an increasingly warmer world, all weather events are affected by it.\nThe costs of inaction can be measured in lost lives and livelihoods, lost homes and businesses, higher food costs and insurance premiums, and hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency services and disaster relief. So the question is not whether we need to act, but whether we will have the courage to act before it\'s too late.

The same week President Barack Obama used his State of the Union to warn Congress that the victims of gun violence "deserve a vote" on gun legislation, the National Rifle Association has gone on the offensive against attempts to ban high-capacity magazines that carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition.\nThe NRA, the nation\'s largest gun rights lobby, released an ad on Thursday that suggested banning high-capacity magazines will turn the country into a crime-ridden nightmare where only the wealthy are protected from murderers and thieves.\nThe ad points out that Secret Service and other law enforcement officers will not be barred from using the high-capacity magazines, while criminals would still be able to purchase them on the black market. "It\'s just the rest of us, the law-abiding people, who will have to defend our families with limited-capacity magazines," a narrator intones. "Welcome to Barack Obama\'s middle class."\nHigh-capacity magazines and some semi-automatic weapons were banned for 10 years under a law signed by President Bill Clinton. It expired in 2004.\nMeanwhile, the NRA\'s vice president, Wayne LaPierre, wrote an op-ed in the Daily Caller on Thursday warning that gun owners must "stand and fight" against any attempts at gun control. “Hurricanes. Tornadoes. Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone criminals. These are perils we are sure to face—not just maybe. It\'s not paranoia to buy a gun. It\'s survival. It\'s responsible behavior, and it\'s time we encourage law-abiding Americans to do just that," he wrote.\nPolls show a majority of Americans support banning high-capacity magazines, as well as closing loopholes that allow some gun buyers to evade federal background checks before purchasing a weapon. (The background checks screen out felons and people who have been declared mentally ill by a judge from purchasing weapons.)\nThe NRA has also taken a stand against the background checks.\n"When it comes to the issue of background checks, let’s be honest—background checks will never be \'universal\'—because criminals will never submit to them," LaPierre said at a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting last month.\nA ban on certain semi-automatic weapons pushed by Obama and some Democrats in Congress enjoys less popular support than either the magazine ban or background checks.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to a magazine as a clip.

Helicopters and a 747 at your disposal; courtside seats at any NBA playoff game of your choice; everyone stands up and the band plays when you come into the room.\nBut the job comes with some baggage, and one of the heaviest of steamer trunks is what to do about a political ally—make that three or four of them—who hands you a stinging defeat on a key, emotionally laden issue.\nAfter the Newtown massacre, you put gun control—sorry, you call it “gun safety” now to avoid ruffling red state sensibilities—back on the table. You give powerful speeches surrounded by the grieving families of the kids who were killed at Sandy Hook. You see a gun rights Democrat, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, and a gun rights Republican, Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey draft a bill that provides a kind of, sort of, sprinkled-with-exceptions background check.\nAnd then you see four Democratic senators vote “no.” Three of them—Mark Begich of Alaska, Max Baucus of Montana, Mark Pryor of Arkansas—were up for re-election next year (Begich and Pryor still are, but since the vote Baucus has decided not to run) in states where gun rights sentiment runs strong, and where Obama lost last year by wide margins.\nWhat do you do now? For some on your side of this fight the answer is easy. William Daley, your former chief of staff and a member of the Chicago political family that has always played politics as a contact sport, says he’ll tell the apostates to look elsewhere for campaign contributions.\nSome of your own supporters make a different point. They say you’re too soft, unwilling to back a senator up against the wall, stick your face in his (or hers), and get the vote you want—the way Lyndon Johnson used to do.\nBut you’ve got other considerations to think about. Next years’ midterms are going to be dicey under any circumstances, at least if history is a guide. Presidents in their sixth year almost always find their party losing seats in the Congress. With the retirement of Democrats in tough states such as South Dakota, West Virginia and Montana (Obama performed dismally in all three last year), your party’s hold on the Senate is in jeopardy. Cutting two incumbent Democrats loose significantly raises the chances that your party will lose the Senate. And if that happens, you can say goodbye to your domestic agenda, not to mention your federal judgeship nominations.\nWhat you’re facing, it turns out, is the same dilemma that any president, any major officeholder faces: How much are you willing to live with in order to pursue a broader agenda?\nFDR had to deal with Southern segregationists—and outright racists—who held power in Congress, so he had to yield to that power in order to get his New Deal legislation passed. As the Digital History website tells it: "Most New Deal programs discriminated against blacks. The NRA, for example, not only offered whites the first crack at jobs, but authorized separate and lower pay scales for blacks.

Deer Trail, a small Colorado town, is considering a measure that would allow its residents to hunt for federal drones and shoot them down.\n"Is it illegal? Of course it is. But it\'s also illegal to spy on American citizens," resident Phillip Steel told CNN in a phone interview. "If they fly in town, we will shoot them down."\nSteel said he wrote the ordinance after he learned the Federal Aviation Administration "loosened regulations that would allow the flight of drones in domestic airspace."\nThe FAA recently announced plans to create six drone test sites around the country, none of which has been publicly listed. It plans to allow widespread use of domestic drones in 2015. "The overall purpose of this test site program is to develop a body of data and operational experiences to inform integration and the safe operation of these aircraft in the National Airspace System," the agency said.\nDrones are cheaper to operate than helicopters. They can be used for multiple tasks, such as monitoring crops and livestock and assessing building damage.\nDeer Trail, which bills itself as the "Home of the World\'s First Rodeo," has 584 residents and is 50 miles outside Aurora. The entire town takes up less than one square mile. Any resident can petition for a citizens\' initiative and then draft an ordinance.\nBounties and shotguns\nThe Town Board of Trustees will vote on the drone ordinance on August 6. If passed, it would legalize the sale of drone hunting licenses for $25 and offer bounties for captured drones. Six trustees and the mayor make up the board. It would take a simple majority vote to pass the ordinance.\n"It is very symbolic ... it\'s asserting our right and drawing a line in the sand," Steel said. "It declares sovereignty of the airspace."\nThe ordinance doesn\'t aim to stop airliner flights, he said. It outlines the rules of engagement for drone hunters and the types of ammunition allowed. Bounty amounts from $25 to $100, and weapons are limited to 12-gauge shotguns.\nIt states that "no background investigation shall be performed" on those seeking a drone hunting license. Additionally, the licenses would be "issued on an anonymous basis."\n"Unmanned aerial vehicles may be engaged at a vertical distance of one thousand feet or less," and the "licenses shall only remain valid within the geographic boundaries of the Town of Deer Trail, Colorado," according to the ordinance.\nFederal legislation (18 USC 1361) prohibits stealing or damaging federal government property and establishes provisions for fines and imprisonment.\nThe illegality of the actions within the ordinance doesn\'t scare Steel.\n"I took an oath when I joined the military to protect the U.S. Constitution. That oath did not end when I left," he said.\nWhen asked if he had ever seen a drone in Deer Trail, Steel said, "In real life, no. I hope I never see a drone in Deer Trail. ... This ordinance is a statement against the coming surveillance society. It\'s a very clear statement against that."\n"In all practicality, nobody is going to shoot down any drones any time soon," he added.\n\'Our mark on the map\'\nTown Clerk Kim Oldfield says she believes the ordinance could benefit the town.\n"This could actually be something to help fund a community center or build us some roads. We need to find our mark on the map," Oldfield said. "The novelty of being allowed to buy a drone-hunting license could turn into a fun thing."\nBoard of Trustees member David Boyd said the ordinance has a good chance of passing.\n"I think it\'s important. I know Phil Steel also wants to make a statement about drones. ... Mostly for us, the outcome we want will be to have some fun and make some money," Boyd said.\nDeer Trail Mayor Frank Fields says he agrees with Boyd. He said the purpose of the ordinance would be "to have fun and bring in business, tourism and activities for people in town."\nColorado Attorney General John W. Suthers said state residents have a sense of humor. He responded to the idea of the ordinance by saying, "A resolution by the town of Deer Trail to allow the hunting of drones is made in the same spirit as the proposal of some rural Coloradans to create a separate state. And both ideas have the same chance to legally succeed: none."

GOP miscalculates on filibuster against gun legislation, especially as Newtown families begin to lobby Congress?.... Latest on the Manchin-Toomey talks… Too soon to read the 2014 tea leaves… Robin Kelly expected to cruise to victory in IL-2 special; polls close at 8:00 pm ET… Colbert Busch releases first TV ad of general election in SC-1… On the unbalanced “special relationship”… And Henry Clay wins First Read’s SENATE MADNESS contest.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks to the press after the weekly Senate Republicans policy luncheon on March 19, 2013 in Washington, DC.\n*** GOP miscalculates on filibuster? As the Senate is expected to consider gun-regulation legislation in the next few days, President Obama’s speech in Connecticut on Monday had one purpose: to shame Republicans vowing to filibuster the legislation. “When I said in my State of the Union address that these proposals deserve a vote … virtually every member of that chamber stood up and applauded,” Obama said. “And now they’re going to start denying your families a vote when the cameras are off and when the lobbyists have worked what they do? You deserve better than that. You deserve a vote.” We know why Senate Republicans want to filibuster the legislation (they want to block it, of course), and we know why Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has joined the effort (he doesn’t want any opposition from the right as he runs for re-election next year). But it’s hard not to view the filibuster attempt as a potential strategic error just on the politics. Why? Because it paints the GOP as obstructionists, and it lowers the bar for victory for Obama (to simply beating the GOP filibuster). Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) said as much over the weekend. “I don’t understand it,” he said. “What are we afraid of?…If this issue is as important as all of us think it is…why not take it up and debate?”\n*** Especially as Newtown families begin lobbying Congress: And as these Newtown families begin lobbying -- NBC’s Kristen Welker says there are 11 family members in DC today pushing Congress for stiffer gun laws -- this obstruction strategy could end up backfiring, with some Republican senators who might not think this is worth the political capital. Remember, Senate Republicans already have a built in “pocket veto” of sorts on the legislation itself -- it’s called the Republican controlled House of Representatives. While we understand the base politics on this issue, this seems to be yet another way the GOP brand is getting tarnished with swing voters, even with voters who may be sympathetic with the pro-gun argument but are turned off by the idea of how politics is practiced in Washington right now.\n*** Latest on the Manchin-Toomey talks: Meanwhile, NBC’s Welker reports that Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) are making PROGRESS on reaching a compromise on background checks, according to a source familiar with the talks (who puts the odds at success at 50%-50%). The compromise would require background checks for purchases at gun shows and on the internet -- but NOT for person-to-person sales. The deal would also require sellers to keep a record of background checks. One other event of note today: At 2:00 pm ET, Vice President Biden and Attorney General Eric Holder deliver remarks at the White House to press Congress to enact gun-control changes.\n*** Too soon to read the 2014 tea leaves: The Cook Political Report’s Charlie Cook examines the two competing narratives about the still-developing 2014 midterms. The first is that the GOP’s unpopularity and its tattered brand will dominate next year’s races, which would produce minimal gains/losses in the House and the inability for Republicans to win control of the Senate. The second narrative is that problems implementing Obama’s health-care law, as well as the incumbent party’s “six-year itch” performance, will hurt Democrats and possibly give the GOP an opening to retake the Senate. Cook’s ultimate conclusion: “At this point, it’s just wisest to watch over the next six or eight months to see which of these narratives seem to gain traction, or alternatively, if some other dynamic seems to be taking hold.” After all, in April of ’09, few could see that the GOP was poised for a historic midterm win about 20 months later. Similarly, in April of ’11 (when the unemployment rate was at 9%), few were expecting a decisive 2012 cycle for the Democrats.\n*** But several moving 2014 parts: Still, there also are several moving 2014 storylines out there. One, it appears Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has two different primary challengers… Per the AP, Rep. Steve King (R-IA) might not run for Iowa’s open Senate seat… And in South Dakota, you have two Democrats potentially vying for that open seat (Tim Johnson’s son, as well as former Rep. Stephanie Herseth-Sandlin).\n*** Kelly expected to cruise to victory in IL-2 special: Today, Chicago-area voters head to the polls in the special general election to fill the congressional seat vacated by former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D-IL). And the Democratic nominee, Cook County Chief Administrative Officer Robin Kelly, is expected to easily win. For one thing, the district overwhelmingly leans Democratic. Secondly, as Roll Call writes, Republican nominee Paul McKinley is a convicted felon, serving nearly 20 years in state prison for burglary and aggravated battery. Polls close at 8:00 pm ET.\n*** Colbert Busch releases first general-election TV ad: Speaking of special congressional elections, Democrat Elizabeth Colbert Busch is up with her first general-election TV ad in that South Carolina contest, and it’s a positive bio spot. “I’m Elizabeth Colbert Busch, and as a single mom raising three young children, I had to be independent and do what’s right for them. Now, I’m going to take that lesson to Congress,” she says in the ad. “I won\'t take any special-interest pledges or follow any party line. To create jobs in South Carolina, we need a well-educated and skilled workforce, and we need to get rid of government waste. The deficit is killing jobs.”\n*** Unbalanced “special relationship”: It’s ambassador-picking season again, and top donors are likely to be part of the equation for plum posts once again. Ambassadors to the United Kingdom have so overwhelmingly been political appointees -- just one career diplomat has served as the top man in London in more than 200 years of the U.S. sending envoys to Britain. This is very different than the way the U.K. picks ambassadors to Washington. They are traditionally the best-of-the-best career diplomats. The one American Foreign Service Officer who’s held the post is Raymond Seitz under George H.W. Bush. Seitz is regarded as one of the best ambassadors to the U.K. post-World War II. One of us tracked him down and interviewed him on the state of play of doling out ambassadorships and looks at the reasons for the unbalanced “special relationship” when it comes to picking ambassadors. Seitz, by the way, now retired, is living in a small New Hampshire town, where he’s proudly the non-salaried deputy supervisor of the town dump. “It is a kind of political appointment,” he said, “but I take my duties seriously.”\n*** Senate Madness -- The Winner: Henry Clay: Out of more than 4,500 votes cast yesterday, Henry Clay (“The Great Compromiser”) defeated Ted Kennedy (“The Last Lion”) in our Senate Madness contest pitting history’s most consequential senators. Thanks to everyone who participated in this fun -- and very educational -- exercise.\n*** Who was Henry Clay? Henry Clay’s (D-R-Whig, 1777-1852) ability to navigate a fractured Senate is credited with fending off war between slave-owning and free states -- at least three times. He was pivotal in the negotiations in the creation of the Missouri Compromise, which allowed the United States to continue its Western expansion. For his efforts, Clay earned the nicknames “The Great Compromiser” and “The Great Pacificator.” How revered was he? Abraham Lincoln called him "my beau ideal of a statesman" and often used his quotes in his speeches. He was the first ever to receive the honor of being laid in state in the Capitol Rotunda. Clay also engineered the only censure of a president -- Andrew Jackson. Clay\'s death, which took place a decade before the Civil War\'s start, was regarded as the end of the Senate\'s "Golden Era."\nClick here to sign up for First Read emails.\nText FIRST to 622639, to sign up for First Read alerts to your mobile phone.\nCheck us out on Facebook and also on Twitter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The senator leading the charge to revive a assault weapons ban conceded on Sunday, just days before hearings on gun control open, that winning Senate passage will be tough but said she has been assured she will have the chance to bring it up for a vote.\nPresident Barack Obama, who has made gun control a top priority after 20 children and six adults were killed by a gunman on December 14 at a Connecticut school, said in remarks published on Sunday that gun control advocates should take into account the views of rural Americans who use guns for hunting.\n“Part of being able to move this forward is understanding the reality of guns in urban areas are very different from the realities of guns in rural areas,” Obama told The New Republic magazine as he continued his administration’s outreach to gun owners even as he seeks new gun restrictions.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein said Majority Leader Harry Reid has promised that even if the assault weapons ban is left out of a broader package intended to curb gun violence, she will have the opportunity to offer it as an amendment on the Senate floor.\nFeinstein introduced legislation last Thursday to ban military-style assault weapons like the one used by the gunman in last month’s school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and high-capacity ammunition clips.\n“This has always been an uphill fight. This has never been easy. This is the hardest of the hard,” Feinstein, a California Democrat, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program.\n“Now, will it (gun violence legislation) only be assault weapons? No, most likely. There will be a package put together. If assault weapons is left out of the package ... I’ve been assured by the majority leader I’ll be able to do it as an amendment on the (Senate) floor, which is the way I did it in 1993,” Feinstein added.\nFeinstein was referring to the previous U.S. assault weapon ban that she authored. That law expired in 2004 after 10 years in effect and Congress refused to extend it.\nNo major gun control legislation has made it through Congress in two decades in the face of opposition from the National Rifle Association and its gun rights allies.\nRepublicans generally oppose gun restrictions and many Democrats, particularly those representing rural areas, also support gun rights. Reid has been a long-time backer of gun rights.\nAsked if she concedes that getting the Senate to pass a new assault weapons ban would be tough, Feinstein said, “I concede because the NRA is venal. They come after you. They put together large amounts of money to defeat you. They did this in ‘93 and they intend to continue it.”\nWayne LaPierre, chief executive officer and executive vice president of the Virginia-based NRA, is among the witnesses scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing on Wednesday on reducing gun violence.\nRURAL VIEWS ON GUNS\nObama, in the magazine interview, said bridging a cultural divide in attitudes to gun ownership will be critical to his administration’s push to curb gun violence.\n“If you grew up and your dad gave you a hunting rifle when you were 10, and you went out and spent the day with him and your uncles, and that became part of your family’s traditions, you can see why you’d be pretty protective of that,” Obama said.\nObama wants the ban on military-style assault weapons, a proposal that faces a tough battle in Congress, as well as mandatory background checks for all gun buyers, a step viewed as having a better chance of success.\nThe United States has a long-standing gun culture and the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms.\nVice President Joe Biden on Friday took the administration’s case for gun control to the gun-friendly state of Virginia, part of a White House strategy to urge the public to pressure Congress into passing laws aimed at curbing firearms violence.\nFeinstein’s legislation would prohibits the sale, manufacture, transfer and importation of 157 military-style assault weapons. It would ban an additional group of assault weapons that can accept a detachable ammunition magazine and have one or more military characteristics.\nIt also would ban large-capacity magazines and other ammunition feeding devices that hold more than 10 rounds and shooters to fire numerous rounds in rapid succession without reloading.

Influential figures on both sides of the gun control debate tangled Wednesday over the effectiveness of background checks, with the husband of wounded former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords urging an overhaul and a top National Rifle Association official saying "homicidal maniacs" will skirt the system no matter what.\nNRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre was the final witness to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee as the panel begins to consider new legislation. He argued that more security and more enforcement, but not new laws, is the answer to gun violence.\nHe specifically knocked down a call by President Obama and others for "universal" background checks, particularly at gun shows.\n"When it comes to background checks, let\'s be honest -- background checks will never be universal because criminals will never submit to them," LaPierre said.\nBut Giffords\' husband Mark Kelly argued that improving the background check system should be a priority. He said holes in the law "make a mockery" of the system -- echoing Obama\'s recent proposal, he called for submitting private sales to background checks as well. He further argued that stronger background checks could have prevented the mass shooting in January 2011 where his wife was shot in the head.\nLaPierre later got into an argument over the issue with Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., after LaPierre argued that more background checks would merely subject "law-abiding people" to more taxes and fees and hassle without going after "bad guys."\n"Mr. LaPierre that\'s the point," Durbin said. "The criminals won\'t get to purchase the guns because there\'ll be a background check. We\'ll stop them from the original purchase -- you missed that point completely. I think it\'s basic."\nRaising his voice, LaPierre said: "Senator, I think you missed the point!" Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then banged the gavel and called for order.\nThe disagreement was one of several sticking points as the Senate Judiciary Committee held the first gun control hearing since Obama released a comprehensive gun control plan earlier this month.\nLaPierre pressed for enforcing existing laws over creating new ones. "Prosecuting criminals who misuse firearms works," LaPierre testified. "Unfortunately, we\'ve seen a dramatic collapse in federal gun prosecutions in recent years."\nHe continued: "Proposing more gun control laws, while failing to enforce the thousands we already have -- it\'s not a serious solution for reducing crime."\nThe panel was stacked with high-profile witnesses on both sides of the debate. Giffords, who was shot while meeting with constituents outside an Arizona supermarket in January 2011, made a surprise appearance at the start of the hearing Wednesday morning to urge Congress to act.\n"We must do something," Giffords said, speaking slowly but clearly. "It will be hard, but the time is now. ... You must act."\nGiffords urged lawmakers to "be bold, be courageous." She later met with President Obama at the White House.\n"Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying," the former congresswoman said. Six people were killed, and 12 were wounded, in the Arizona attack. The fatal shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., last month brought the issue of gun control back to the fore of the congressional agenda.\nKelly, speaking after his wife, called for a "careful and civil conversation" about limitations on firearms. He noted that he and Giffords own guns, but are "anti-gun violence."\nHe said a "matrix" of failures contributes to the country\'s gun violence problem, including mental illness and poverty, but also gun laws. He said the complexity is "not an excuse for inaction." Kelly said weapons designed to inflict maximum damage have turned corners of America "into places of carnage and gross human loss."\nKelly briefly described how the 2011 shooting affected his family, leaving his wife partially blind and struggling to walk. Kelly and Giffords have formed a political action committee called Americans for Responsible Solutions to back lawmakers who support tighter gun restrictions and counter the influence of the NRA.\nLaPierre, though, argued that prosecution for federal weapons violations in 2011 was essentially down 35 percent, compared to previous administrations, which he says means violent felons, gang members and the mentally ill who possess firearms are not being prosecuted.\n"That is completely and totally unacceptable," said LaPierre, who suggested fixing the country\'s "broken" mental-health system become part of the solution to gun violence -- including making patient records part of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\nThe hearing, titled "What Should America Do about Gun Violence," takes place roughly seven weeks after a lone gunman with psychological problems used an assault weapon to kill 20 first-graders and six adults inside a Connecticut elementary school, prompting renewed calls for more gun control.\nThe NRA, with 4.5 million active members, remains the most powerful gun-rights advocacy group in the country.\nObama is calling for a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, along with more extensive background checks.\nLaPierre said the group is willing to work with Congress and the president in curbing gun violence, but "law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals. Nor do we believe the government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families."\nUnder questioning from Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Baltimore County Police Chief James Johnson said Wednesday that the current background check system has already stopped nearly 2 million "prohibited purchases" between 1994 and 2009.\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has already introduced legislation taking similar steps to Obama\'s proposals.\nThe California Democrat on Tuesday said she will hold her own hearing on gun control because she was unhappy that three of the five witnesses testifying Wednesday are "skewed against us." Feinstein is a member of the Judiciary Committee.\nDespite the momentum gun control advocates have gained since the massacre in Newtown, Conn, it will be difficult for them to prevail in Congress this year because of the popularity of guns in many states -- including several represented by Democratic senators -- and the formidable muscle of the NRA on Capitol Hill, lawmakers and others say.\nAmong other obstacles, the Republican-run House has shown little immediate interest in making dramatic changes in the laws.\nAt the Senate hearing, Leahy, D-Vt., said lawmakers were not trying to take away Americans\' guns.\n"They\'re not at risk. ... what is at risk are lives," he said.\nThe committee\'s top Republican, Sen. Charles Grassley, said he welcomed the "renewed discussion" on gun violence.\nBut he voiced skepticism about a renewed ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

And the president said he was skeptical about the NRA proposal to put policemen in all schools in this country. Yet he and his family are beneficiaries of multiple law enforcement officers surrounding them 24-hours a day. That\'s the real issue. Anything else is an attempted calculated distraction."\nEarlier post:\nAs President Obama prepared to unveil a legislative package attacking gun violence, the National Rifle Association has a new video attacking Obama -- and citing his children.\nThe 35-second video criticizes Obama\'s skepticism of proposals to put armed guards in all schools, while noting that his daughters receive Secret Service protection.\n"Are the president\'s kids more important than yours?" the narrator says. "Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school? Mr. Obama demands the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, but he\'s just another elitist hypocrite when it comes to a fair share of security."\nThe law provides Secret Service protection for the president and his immediate family.\nOn Wednesday, Obama and Vice President Biden unveiled an anti-gun violence plan that includes proposals for a new assault weapons ban, universal background checks on all weapon purchases, and restrictions on the size of ammunition magazines.\nThe new gun control push comes a month after the mass killing that claimed 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn.\nThe White House schedule says Obama and Biden " will be joined by children from around the country who wrote the president letters in the wake of the Newtown tragedy expressing their concerns about gun violence and school safety, along with their parents."

There are days when Congress seems determined to earn its 12% approval rating -- and that 14 Republican senators are threatening to filibuster any new gun legislation should make your blood boil if you still have a heart to pump it with.\nFour months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School slaughter, the vast majority of Americans still support some sensible new gun laws, but the same legislation has been declared DOA by conservative senators.\nIt\'s enough for some activists to crow that the NRA\'s strategy to stall until public attention moved elsewhere has succeeded. The old argument after a mass shooting -- "it\'s too soon" -- has been revealed to be the delay and dodge it always was.\nAnd an astounding 91% of Americans back universal background checks -- including 88% of Republicans, according to a Quinnipiac poll. Reality check: 90% of Americans don\'t agree on the awesomeness of apple pie and vanilla ice cream. The disconnect between Congress and Main Street America has rarely been so stark.\nThis should be a no-brainer -- especially because the most "controversial" initial proposals have been dropped because they were considered too politically difficult to pass. Those included a reinstatement of the assault weapons ban, which is only supported by a narrow majority of the American people, and a limit on high-capacity magazines\nDemocratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was hotly criticized by liberals for backing off this proposal, but he cited pragmatism -- the need to get 60 votes for passage.\nThat Reid himself has enjoyed high ratings from the NRA and is looking out for the political fortunes of red state Democrats running for re-election was a source of some suspicion. But even Reid\'s attempt to put forward a less polarizing bill has been met by the threatened Republican filibuster. There seems to be no reward for being reasonable.\nWhen Rand Paul filibustered the nomination of CIA Director John Brennan, I cheered -- not because I agreed, but because it was a principled attempt to educate the American people on drone strike policy and because Paul pursued the filibuster the traditional "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" way, taking the Senate floor rather than blocking debate with a parliamentary maneuver. But this threatened filibuster on guns follows the old obscure obstructionist ways, blocking debate and accountability rather than encouraging it.\nThe arguments would-be filibusterers such as Sens. Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, Mitch McConnell and Mike Enzi are making sound as if they are principled -- if you don\'t pay attention to the facts.\nHere\'s Enzi\'s take: "The measures proposed currently by the majority do not reduce crime, they simply restrict the American public\'s constitutional right to self-defense. ... These bills would take away one of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights and proponents won\'t stop with these restrictions."\nHis statement is a combination of fictitious fear-mongering ("These bills would take away one of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights") and the dystopian slippery slope ("and proponents won\'t stop with these restrictions.")\nLet\'s start with a reality check on the most predictable of the oppositional bumper stickers: the "assault on Second Amendment."\nMoreover, there exists the right to reasonable restrictions, such as the ban on machine guns that has existed in the USA since the 1930s and originally passed with NRA support. But don\'t take my word for it -- listen to conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who wrote in the landmark Heller Decision, which declared D.C.\'s functional ban on handguns unconstitutional:\n"Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues.\n"The Court\'s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. [United States v.] Miller\'s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those \'in common use at the time\' finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons."\nGot that? Unless gun advocates are going to start calling Scalia a RINO (Republican In Name Only), there should be some room here for reasonable debate.\nYes, we need to acknowledge that Americans use guns differently in urban and rural areas. That\'s one reason liberal former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean had an A rating from the NRA when he ran for president in 2004. But if politically difficult but clearly constitutional measures such as an assault weapons ban, which Ronald Reagan backed, aren\'t included in the proposed legislation, we surely should be able to debate this issue rationally and in the open.\nThat\'s another reason this position is infuriatingly stupid -- it compounds the number one negative perception about the Republican Party. Namely, that it is "inflexible and unwilling to compromise."\nRepublicans such as Rudy Giuliani and John McCain have pointed out the counterproductive nature of this threatened filibuster, with McCain saying on CBS\' "Face the Nation": "The purpose of the United States Senate is to debate and to vote and to let the people know where we stand." He added, sensibly: "What are we afraid of?"\nRepublican senators are afraid of a conservative primary challenge fueled by huge amounts of outside money backed by activists and lobbying groups such as the NRA.\nI genuinely believe that both parties have good ideas and good people -- and principled voices are arguing for a constructive compromise and a real debate on this issue.\nOpponents can\'t even defend their inaction by arguing they are representing their constituents because of the overwhelming bipartisan margins for the proposed increased background checks and cracking down on gun-trafficking. But hyperpartisan politics are once again threatening to trump policy-driven problem solving. That\'s why Congress has such a dismal approval rating in the first place.\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, parents who lost children in the Newtown massacre will be walking the halls of Congress, trying to appeal to the conscience of our legislators. It will be interesting to see whether their personal appeals will carry as much weight as the influence of gun lobbyists.\nThis issue isn\'t academic -- it is an urgent test of our elected representatives\' ability to be responsive to the public will and reason together.\nIf Newtown can\'t get Washington\'s attention, what will? The shooting of a colleague, Gabby Giffords, apparently didn\'t. Conscience and compassion should matter more than cold hard cash.

Despite Wendy Davis\' dramatic filibuster delaying Texas\' abortion bill, the Republican-dominated Texas legislature is expected to support the measure which would ban most abortions for women more than 20 weeks pregnant. Just this year, 17 states passed new measures impacting abortion. NBC\'s Kate Snow reports.\nTexas legislators overturned a temporary victory by state Democrats and standard bearer Sen. Wendy Davis, passing a bill late Friday that puts new restrictions on abortion procedures.\nThe bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate just before midnight, two weeks after the Legislature failed to put the restrictions to a successful vote in its first special session. The bill would ban most abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy, place new requirements on which facilities could perform the procedures and limit a woman’s ability to induce an abortion by taking a pill.\nAbortion rights advocates, including Planned Parenthood of Texas, have said that the new law would effectively shut down all but six of the facilities where abortions are performed in the state.\nPro- and anti-abortion activists flooded the Texas Capitol on Friday afternoon, setting the stage for a dramatic ideological showdown. Abortion rights advocates wearing orange were holding gynecological devices and signs, while anti-abortion advocates dressed in blue carried images of fetuses and Bible verses, according to The Associated Press.\nTwenty-one amendments were offered, debated and rejected. As debate progressed, reporters inside the chamber said protesters could be heard chanting outside, and some protesters who were in the gallery were removed after outbursts.\nAs the time ticked toward midnight, senators offered passionate arguments on either side.\nGov. Rick Perry had made passing House Bill 2 a priority and said he will sign it into law.\nIn a statement after the bill passed, Perry said: This legislation builds on the strong and unwavering commitment we have made to defend life and protect women\'s health. I am proud of our lawmakers, and citizens who tirelessly defended our smallest and most vulnerable Texans and future Texans."\nDemocrats in the legislature have said that while there was little they could do to keep the bill from passing, they plan to challenge it in federal court.\n“We do not have the numbers to stop it,” said Democratic Sen. Royce West of Dallas, according to The Associated Press. “As soon as it’s signed by the governor, it will be challenged … we believe the whole bill is unconstitutional.”\nTexas is only one of several states looking to tighten rules for abortions.\nNorth Carolina\'s House passed a bill Thursday that directs state regulators to change standards for abortion clinics to bring them in line with more regulated outpatient surgical centers.\nMissouri\'s governor Friday let a bill become law without his signature that requires doctors to be in the room for the initial dose of a drug used in medication abortions.\nWisconsin’s governor signed into law last week a measure similar to Texas\' that forces abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. That law was blocked by a federal judge.\nThe biggest fireworks have come in Texas. Last month, GOP lawmakers were prevented from carrying out a vote on House Bill 2 as their first special session came to an end after Davis delivered an 11-hour filibuster that was cut short when state senators ruled she had committed three rules infractions. Raucous protests from Davis supporters in the gallery prevented lawmakers from carrying out a valid vote on the bill.\nSecurity was tightened before the final vote Friday. Dozens of state troopers surrounded the gallery and monitored the hallways Friday, according to the AP.\nTroopers inspected bags of people streaming into the halls of the capitol. Senate Sergeant-At-Arms Rick DeLeon said no props would be permitted in the gallery, including tampons, perfume bottles, and moisturizers, the AP reported.\nSen. Kirk Watson of Austin, the leader of the legislature’s Democrats, said he stepped in to prevent troopers from confiscating feminine hygiene products from women hoping to view the debate, according to the AP.\nThe fight over the bill has drawn national attention from abortion rights advocates disturbed by the spread of new restrictions, as well as anti-abortion activists who say the new law would protect the health of mothers and fetuses.\nFormer contender for the GOP presidential nomination Rick Santorum appeared in Austin on Thursday, and said that “Texas is the center of the pro-life debate in the country right now,” according to Reuters.\nRelated:\nThis story was originally published on Sat Jul 13, 2013 1:31 AM EDT\nPopular Discussions

(Eric Gay / Associated Press)\nU.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel said in that the admitting-privileges requirement violated the rights of doctors to do what they thought was best for patients. But the judge said restrictions on medication-induced abortions should stand “except when a physician finds such an abortion necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.”

President Barack Obama\'s administration has unveiled an opt-out for religious groups that object to covering birth control in their staff health plans.\nInsurance companies, and not faith-based employers, would bear the cost of providing contraception to employees.\nThe move is an effort to appease faith-based organisations, such as hospitals and universities, who objected to the requirement they provide such coverage.\nOriginally, the exemption was narrowly defined to focus on houses of worship.\nUnder Friday\'s announcement, free contraception will be provided for staff of faith-based organisations under a plan that is separate to the employer\'s healthcare policy.\nThis will exempt those bodies from "contracting, arranging, paying or referring for such coverage".\n\'Respecting religious concerns\'\nRoman Catholic bishops, evangelical leaders and other religious figureheads had lobbied for a broader exemption to the contraception requirement.\nMore than 40 lawsuits have been filed by religious groups and charities which say the requirement violates their religious beliefs.\nIt was not clear whether the new rules would satisfy religious leaders who were unhappy with the original requirement.\nBut Sarah Lipton, policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the rule met their goal of offering "seamless coverage" of contraception to those who would have been affected.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said the new rules would provide "women across the nation with coverage of recommended preventive care at no cost, while respecting religious concerns".\nThe regulations are part of a landmark healthcare bill passed by President Obama, known as the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\nThey require most US employers to include access to contraception, including sterilisation, in their health insurance plans.\nThe latest changes say groups that identify themselves as religious and offer private insurance must allow women to receive contraceptive services directly from the insurer.\nIn cases where the group is self-insured, a third party would provide the coverage.\nThe health and human services department has said any costs for the scheme would be covered by a deduction in federal user fees for the policy issuer.\nSupporters of the regulations say it would give women the freedom to make their own healthcare choices.\nThe latest rules do not specify a work-around for individual business owners who have religious objections to the rule.\nThe latest changes are open to public comment for 60 days.

Concerned citizens lined the gallery of the State Capitol to watch the debate unfold for the Republicans\' ultrasound probe law which will require unnecessary and invasive medical treatments on any women seeking an abortion. The bill had already passed through the State Senate, with the dramatic and demonstrably uncivil silencing of any minority party debate, as chronicled by Giles Goat Boy. The lack of collegiality demonstrated by Senate Majority Leader Mike Ellis is nothing short of breathtaking, even for those of us a bit short of breath from two years of constant struggle against this radical governance franchise that has overtaken the state. Witnesses in the gallery testify that he actually broke his gavel from his aggressive pummeling of procedural protocol. That was on Wednesday.\nOne day later, yesterday, and only two weeks since the Republicans introduced it, the bill passed the House on a 56 to 39 vote. During what passed for debate, the citizens in the gallery sat silent, some with duct tape over their mouths. The gallery was lined with Capitol Police, whose job it is to oversee the increasingly detailed and labyrinthine sets of rules of conduct and laws restricting assembly that have been put in place during the last two years. It has been clear that signage is no longer allowed in the gallery, nor is photography, nor recording devices of any kinds. I don\'t know that we were cognizant that silence would not be allowed. That\'s right: in Wisconsin, our silence has been silenced!\nAccording to the twitter stream of Madison writer and activist Rebecca Kemble\'s eyewitness account:\nWomen with tape over their mouths silently protesting #gynogovt in Assembly Gallery told to take it off. Some of them ejected. #WarOnWomen\nClapping spontaneously erupted after Democratic Representative Sandy Pasch spoke of the importance of access to birth control for women:\nRep. Pasch on AB 216: "The author of this bill is seriously out of touch with the reality of women." #gynogovt #WarOnWomen\nApplause from the gallery causes Speaker Pro Tem Kramer to have people removed without a warning. #gynogovt #WarOnWomen\nDems protesting Kramer\'s ejection of the public from the gallery without a warning. #gynogovt #WarOnWomen\nOne woman was handcuffed and marched out due to her unwillingness to leave the gallery when Rep. Kramer cleared the first two rows due to clapping.\nWomen in the gallery who removed tape from their mouths on the order of Speaker Pro Tem Kramer now holding hands over mouths. #gynogovt\nI\'ll end with that chilling image. A radical bill of serious consequence was fast-tracked through legislature and now waits to be signed by Governor Walker. He\'s already said that he has no problem with ultrasounds, and will readily sign. The Senate allowed no debate, insisting on a rapid and violent roll-call vote. The House allowed the performance of debate and voted along party lines. The citizens watching from the galleries above were surrounded by police. There were no outbursts, no incivility, only one instance of clapping. The first two rows were immediately ejected, without warning, by the order of the Republican Speaker.\nWomen sitting silently with duct tape on their mouths were given the ultimatum: take off your tape, or face arrest. They took off their tape, and sat silently with their hands over their mouths. No talking allowed. No clapping allowed. No noise allowed. No silence allowed.

(AP)\nIn 1970, Washington became the first -- and remains the only -- state in the country to legalize elective abortions by a popular vote.\nA generation later, and 40 years removed from the landmark United States Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling that extended abortion access nationwide, Washington is once again poised to stand out.\nWith 21 states having adopted bans or severe restrictions on insurance companies from paying for abortions, Washington is alone in seriously considering legislation mandating the opposite.\nThe Reproductive Parity Act, as supporters call it, would require insurers in Washington state who cover maternity care -- which all insurers must do -- to also pay for abortions.\nThe bill passed the state House earlier this month by a vote of 53-43, though it faces an uncertain future in the Senate. A similar bill in the New York state Assembly has been introduced each session for over a decade but has never received a public hearing.\n"This is a core value for Washingtonians," said Melanie Smith, a lobbyist for NARAL Pro-Choice Washington. "We should protect it while we still have it and not leave access to basic health care up to an insurance company."\nThe proximate cause of Washington state\'s measure is the federal Affordable Care Act. Thanks to language placed in it to assuage anti-abortion congressional Democrats, insurers selling their plans on the state exchanges taking effect next year will have to segregate the premiums they collect for abortion coverage.\nIn addition to that built-in disincentive to insuring abortion, the law also invites states to enact stricter rules of their own. Thus far, 16 states have followed suit, barring or restricting insurance companies on their exchanges from covering the procedure. Three of those states are joining the five that have barred or limited all insurers from covering abortions since the early 1980\'s.\nSupporters of Washington state\'s proposed abortion insurance mandate are careful to stress that it wouldn\'t lead to a dramatic uptick in abortions or require carriers with a religious bent to cover the procedure. They also note that a pair of federal plans that will be sold on all 50 state exchanges will be barred from covering elective abortions.\n"It\'s not expanding abortion coverage," said Democratic Rep. Eileen Cody of West Seattle, the bill\'s primary sponsor. "It\'s ensuring the rights of women to get what they\'re paying for now and to continue their freedom of choice."\nOpponents counter that the measure would require businesses and individuals to pay for abortion coverage they\'d rather not have.\n"Washington state would be the only state in the country that would force employers to pay for abortion," said Peggy O\'Ban, spokeswoman for Human Life of Washington.\nIf passed, she said, it would amount to "the first conscience coercion act in American history."\nIts passage, however, is not assured.\nProponents of the measure say they have the votes they need in the state Senate, but it\'s not clear that Senate leaders will allow it to get to the floor. It is scheduled to receive a public hearing in the Senate Health Care Committee on April 1.\nIronically, the man bill supporters will likely blame if it fails to get a Senate vote counts himself as a proud backer of the measure.\nSen. Rodney Tom of Medina, a fiscal conservative and social moderate, and one other like-minded Democrat crossed party lines to caucus with Republicans in December, handing a one-vote majority to the GOP. Seizing power for the first time in nearly a decade, elated Senate Republicans reciprocated by installing Tom as Majority Leader.\nLast month, Tom addressed about 250 advocates rallying for the measure\'s passage on the state Capitol steps.\n"I\'m down here making sure that my 17-year-old daughter has the kind of protections that we need in Washington state and that all of our kids have those same kinds of protections," Tom said to cheers.\nMoments later, Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat and fellow bill supporter, delivered a not-so-subtle challenge to Tom\'s political will.\nWashington state "deserves a vote in the state Senate on the Reproductive Parity Act," Inslee said. "We are going to insist that we are not going to let anybody close the door to democracy in this state."\nAnother irony: though the bill has proved to be among the most hotly contested of the session, its broader impact if passed may be less than sweeping.\nFor one thing, most abortions are paid for out-of-pocket. According to the Guttmacher Institute, only 12 percent of abortions nationwide are paid for by private insurers, with 20 percent footed by Medicaid.\nFor another, because most abortions cost less than a live birth -- the procedure typically runs about $500, though late-term abortions are far more expensive -- insurers may be disinclined to stop covering them.\nAt present, all major insurers in Washington state cover abortions, and Cody, the bill\'s sponsor, said she knows of no carrier with plans to change. Insurers new to Washington state on its exchange may be tempted to adopt different policies, she said.\nNo matter its immediate impact, said Elizabeth Nash, states issues manager with the Guttmacher Institute, the bill\'s passage would be a watershed event.\n"It would be a model for other states to follow," she said.

order to distract from the true issue, I think it's critical that we focus on the substance of the policy because it's the right thing to do for Louisiana.&quot;</p>\n<p>[youtube K754cP25fK4]</p>", 'text': 'The head of the Louisiana Democratic Party said on the floor of the state Senate this week that opponents of the federal health care overhaul are motivated by President Obama\'s race -- a remark that drew the scorn of state Republicans who now want her to apologize.\nState Sen. Karen Carter Peterson, who is also chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, repeatedly invoked race as she railed against ObamaCare critics.\n"I have talked to so many members both in the House and the Senate, and you know what? You ready? You ready? What it comes down to? It\'s not about how many federal dollars we can receive, it\'s not about that. You ready? It\'s about race," she said. "I know nobody wants to talk about that. It\'s about the race of this African-American president.\nShe tried to argue that because former House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- who is white -- offered a "similar" overhaul in the past, the criticism this time "comes down to the race of the president of the United States which causes people to disconnect and step away from the substance of the bill."\nThe Republican Party of Louisiana is calling on Peterson to apologize for the comments.\n"Bottom line is it\'s wrong to call someone a racist just because they disagree with you. There are a plethora of reasons why we disagree with ObamaCare ... and the race of the president or of anyone else has absolutely nothing to do with it," Ryan Cross, communications director for the state GOP, told FoxNews.com. "It\'s appalling and it has no place on the floor."\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, also told local affiliate WBRZ that it\'s "wrong to call people racists" simply over opposition to the health law.\nPeterson released a statement Thursday afternoon clarifying her remarks while also defending them.\n"I think we should judge a policy by its content, not the person proposing it," her statement said.\n"To be clear, I didn\'t call any person \'racist.\' Rather, I was simply relaying the truth about conversations I\'ve had with my colleagues and the factors they considered on the expansion of Medicaid.\n"While others are using this as an opportunity to take my comments out of context in order to distract from the true issue, I think it\'s critical that we focus on the substance of the policy because it\'s the right thing to do for Louisiana."\n[youtube K754cP25fK4]

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Texas Senate passed sweeping new abortion restrictions late Friday, sending them to Republican Gov. Rick Perry to sign into law after weeks of protests and rallies that drew thousands of people to the Capitol and made the state the focus of the national abortion debate.\nRepublicans used their large majority in the Texas Legislature to pass the bill nearly three weeks after a filibuster by Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis and an outburst by abortion-rights activists in the Senate gallery disrupted a deadline vote June 25.\nCalled back for a new special session by Perry, lawmakers took up the bill again as thousands of supporters and opponents held rallies and jammed the Capitol to testify at public hearings. As the Senate took its final vote, protesters in the hallway outside the chamber chanted, "Shame! Shame! Shame!"\nDemocrats have called the GOP proposal unnecessary and unconstitutional. Republicans said the measure was about protecting women and unborn children.\nHouse Bill 2 would require doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, allow abortions only in surgical centers, limit where and when women may take abortion-inducing pills and ban abortions after 20 weeks.\nAbortion-rights supporters say the bill will close all but five abortion clinics in Texas, leaving large areas of the vast state without abortion services. Only five out of 42 existing abortion clinics meet the requirements to be a surgical center, and clinic owners say they can\'t afford to upgrade or relocate.\nThe circus-like atmosphere in the Texas Capitol marked the culmination of weeks of protests, the most dramatic of which came June 25 in the final minutes of the last special legislative session, Davis\' filibuster and subsequent protest prevented the bill from becoming law.\nThe Senate\'s debate took place between a packed gallery of demonstrators, with anti-abortion activists wearing blue and abortion-rights supporters wearing orange. Security was tight, and state troopers reported confiscating bottles of urine and feces as they worked to prevent another attempt to stop the Republican majority from passing the proposal.\nThose arrested or removed from the chamber included four women who tried to chain themselves to a railing in the gallery. One of the women was successful in chaining herself, prompting a 10-minute recess.\nWhen debate resumed, protesters began loudly singing, "Give choice a chance. All we are saying is give choice a chance." The Senate\'s leader, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, told officers to remove them.\nSen. Glen Hegar of Katy, the bill\'s Republican author, argued that all abortions, including those induced with medications, should take place in an ambulatory surgical center in case of complications.\nDemocrats pointed out that childbirth is more dangerous than an abortion and there have been no serious problems with women taking abortion drugs at home. They introduced amendments to add exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to remove some of the more restrictive clauses, but Republicans dismissed all of the proposed changes.\nSen. Royce West, a Dallas Democrat, asked why Hegar was pushing restrictions that federal courts in other states had suspended as possibly unconstitutional.\n"There will be a lawsuit. I promise you," West said, raising his right hand as if taking an oath.\nThe bill mirrors restrictions passed in Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kansas, Wisconsin and Arizona. In North Carolina, lawmakers are considering a measure that would allow state health officials to apply standards for ambulatory surgical centers to abortion clinics.\nPassing the law in Texas would be a major victory for anti-abortion activists in the nation\'s second most-populous state. A lawsuit originating in Texas would also likely win a sympathetic hearing at the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nBut Democrats see in the protests an opportunity that could help them break a 20-year statewide losing streak. They believe Republicans have overreached in trying to appease their base and alienated suburban women, a constituency that helped President Barack Obama win re-election.\n"In the long run, all they have done is built a committed group of people across this state who are outraged about the treatment of women and the lengths to which this Legislature will go to take women\'s health care away," Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told The Associated Press in an interview Friday.\nSen. John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat, said during the debate that it was clear the bill was part of national conservative agenda attempting to ban abortion and infringe on women\'s rights one state at a time. He pressed Hegar on why the Texas Medical Association, Texas Hospital Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology opposed the bill.\nHe asked Hegar how he could ignore these experts.\n"There are differences in the medical profession," Hegar insisted, rejecting the criticism. "I don\'t believe this legislation will majorly impede the doctor-patient relationship."\nSen. Bob Deuell, a Greenville Republican and a doctor, defended the bill, saying abortion clinics "had not maintained the proper standard of care."\n___\nAssociated Press writers Will Weissert and Jim Vertuno contributed to this report.

The call was prompted by a Kossack whose son had been helped by the Senator&rsquo;s office. <em>[Thank you, whoever you are!]</em> The call came from the Cincinnati office. The staff person called about <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/01/29/1182934/-This-is-my-last-case-as-Veteran-s-advocate-and-it-s-the-worst-I-ve-ever-seen?showAll=yes%20\xa0">Tom and to offer whatever help the Senator&rsquo;s office could</a>. She was unaware that the Cleveland office already had the case open. While discussing the case, I asked if the Senator would entertain the possibility of correcting what I think is something patently unfair. Here it is:</p>\n<blockquote><a href="https://www.baycitizen.org/news/veterans/disabled-veterans-awaiting-benefits/">From the Bay Citizen:</a><br> <strong>Veterans in metropolitan areas face longer delays for benefits, Bay Citizen analysis reveals</strong><br> <em>by Aaron Glantz &mdash; August 29, 2012, 12:00 a.m.</em> <p>So far, change has headed in the wrong direction, despite increased media and political scrutiny. Nationwide, the VA took an average of more than eight months to process a claim in June &ndash; about 50 percent longer than the year before. Veterans in New York and North Texas waited the longest, at more than a year on average. Those who appeal a denied claim wait 3&frac12; years for an answer.</p> <p>Why the dramatic differences? A VA spokesman did not respond to numerous email and telephone inquiries seeking an explanation.</p> <p>Delays have increased despite a new $300 million computer system and 3,300 claims processors hired since 2010 &ndash; 765 of them for additional positions.<br> The department has pledged to eliminate the claims backlog by 2015, but VA data shows the number of veterans waiting for a decision is growing &ndash; to more than 907,000 as of July 30, with 832,000 of them waiting for disability or survivor benefits, while thousands more seek a pension or GI Bill education benefits.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>According to the most recent tracking [Sunday, Feb. 17, 2013], nationally there are 821,143 Veterans waiting for Disability review decisions. That&rsquo;s a 7.4% increase from last year, with an average wait time of 273 days. Nationally there are 587,351 veterans who have waited more than 125 days.</p>\n<p>In Cleveland where Tom&rsquo;s disability was filed in 1971, then again in 1999, and for a 3rd time one year ago this month, there is a backlog of 25,273 claims, up 16.4% over last year, with a wait time of 334 days. Waiting more than 125 days are 18,971 disability claims. Tom&rsquo;s claim has gone through that hurtle. The claims examiner ignored Tom&rsquo;s psychiatric hospitalization and continued care since 1971 by saying that the military medical records from Germany were insufficient proof.</p>\n<p>Tom now joins 273,714 whose claims have gone to the appeals process. Of that group 14% or 38,320 will be wrongly decided according to the VA. Hosea Roundtree shares Tom&rsquo;s experience. Before you criticize the claims examiner, watch this YouTube [5:19 minutes long].</p>\n<figure><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QW9Biy76gBQ"></iframe></figure>\n<p><a href="http://youtu.be/QW9Biy76gBQ">http://youtu.be/...</a></p>\n<p>The difference between Hosea Roundtree and Tom is that Tom is on dialysis.

Nationwide, the VA took an average of more than eight months to process a claim in June – about 50 percent longer than the year before. Veterans in New York and North Texas waited the longest, at more than a year on average. Those who appeal a denied claim wait 3½ years for an answer.\nWhy the dramatic differences? A VA spokesman did not respond to numerous email and telephone inquiries seeking an explanation.\nDelays have increased despite a new $300 million computer system and 3,300 claims processors hired since 2010 – 765 of them for additional positions.\nThe department has pledged to eliminate the claims backlog by 2015, but VA data shows the number of veterans waiting for a decision is growing – to more than 907,000 as of July 30, with 832,000 of them waiting for disability or survivor benefits, while thousands more seek a pension or GI Bill education benefits.\nAccording to the most recent tracking [Sunday, Feb. 17, 2013], nationally there are 821,143 Veterans waiting for Disability review decisions. That’s a 7.4% increase from last year, with an average wait time of 273 days. Nationally there are 587,351 veterans who have waited more than 125 days.\nIn Cleveland where Tom’s disability was filed in 1971, then again in 1999, and for a 3rd time one year ago this month, there is a backlog of 25,273 claims, up 16.4% over last year, with a wait time of 334 days. Waiting more than 125 days are 18,971 disability claims. Tom’s claim has gone through that hurtle. The claims examiner ignored Tom’s psychiatric hospitalization and continued care since 1971 by saying that the military medical records from Germany were insufficient proof.\nTom now joins 273,714 whose claims have gone to the appeals process.

AP\nJustice Sotomayor blocked the implementation of the mandate\nSotomayor acted on a request from an order of Catholic nuns in Colorado\nPortions of the Affordable Care Act go into effect Jan. 1\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Only hours before the law was to take effect, a Supreme Court justice on Tuesday blocked implementation of part of President Obama\'s health care law that would have forced some religion-affiliated organizations to provide health insurance for employees that includes birth control coverage.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor\'s decision came after a different effort by Catholic-affiliated groups from around the U.S. Those groups had rushed to the federal courts to stop Wednesday\'s start of portions of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\nSotomayor acted on a request from an organization of Catholic nuns in Denver, the Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged. Its request for an emergency stay had been denied earlier in the day by a federal appeals court.\nThe government is "temporarily enjoined from enforcing against applicants the contraceptive coverage requirements imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act," Sotomayor said in the order. She gave government officials until 10 a.m. EST (1500 GMT) Friday to respond to her order.\nThe law requires employers to provide insurance that covers a range of preventive care, free of charge, including contraception. The Catholic Church prohibits the use of contraceptives. That was not acceptable, said the nuns\' lawyer, Mark L. Rienzi.\n"The Little Sisters are an order of Catholic nuns whose religious faith leads them to devote their lives to caring for the elderly poor. Not surprisingly, they have sincere and undisputed religious objections to complying with this Mandate," Rienzi said.\nThe Obama administration crafted a compromise, or accommodation, that attempted to create a buffer for religiously affiliated hospitals, universities and social service groups that oppose birth control. The law requires insurers or the health plan\'s outside administrator to pay for birth control coverage and creates a way to reimburse them.\nBut for that to work, the nuns would have to sign a form authorizing their insurance company to provide contraceptive coverage, which would still violate their beliefs, he said.\n"Without an emergency injunction, Mother Provincial Loraine Marie Maguire has to decide between two courses of action: (a) sign and submit a self-certification form, thereby violating her religious beliefs; or (b) refuse to sign the form and pay ruinous fines," he said.\nThe White House did not comment on the order Tuesday night. Sotomayor issued the order a few hours before leading the final 60-second countdown and pushing the ceremonial button to drop the New Year\'s Eve ball in New York\'s Times Square.\nA spokeswoman for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the lead counsel for the Little Sisters of the Poor, said the group was delighted by Sotomayor\'s order. "The government has lots of ways to deliver contraceptives to people," Emily Hardman said in a statement. "It doesn\'t need to force nuns to participate."\nSotomayor\'s decision to delay the contraceptive portion of the law was joined by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which also issued an emergency stay for Catholic-affiliated groups challenging the contraceptive provision. But one judge on the three-judge panel that made the decision, Judge David S. Tatel, said he would have denied their motion.\n"Because I believe that appellants are unlikely to prevail on their claim that the challenged provision imposes a \'substantial burden\' under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, I would deny their application for an injunction pending appeal," Tatel said.

Eric Gay / AP\nSen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, left, reacts as time expires following her lengthy filibuster.\nA bill that opponents claimed would virtually ban abortion in Texas failed to pass late Tuesday after lawmakers missed a deadline by just minutes.\nThere were chaotic scenes after a filibuster attempt fell just short and protesters cheered, clapped and shouted from 11:45 p.m. to midnight and beyond as lawmakers tried to hold the vote before the session ended at midnight (1 a.m. ET).\nThe filibuster by Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, who wore a back brace, lasted almost 11 hours but ended after three challenges to her speech were upheld.\nThe only way Democrats in the Republican-controlled Senate could defeat the measure was by not letting it come to a vote on Tuesday.\nDemocratic Texas state senator Wendy Davis took over the statehouse floor for a successful marathon filibuster of an abortion-related bill that began Tuesday morning and ended 13 hours later, causing the vote on the bill to miss the deadline. NBC\'s Kelly O\'Donnell reports.\nLt. Gov. David Dewhurst, acting as Senate president, initially said the voting began just before midnight, NBCDFW.com reported, and several reports suggested that the bill had been passed after a 19-10 vote and would go to Gov. Rick Perry.\nBut Dewhurst later announced that the vote had been held too late.\nAt about 3 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET), he said that the special session had expired and the bill could not be “signed in the presence of the Senate … and therefore cannot be enrolled.”\nDewhurst may have hinted Gov. Rick Perry could immediately call another special session, when he told the Senate: "It\'s over. It\'s been fun. But see you soon."\nHe condemned the protesters for staging what they described as "a people\'s filibuster."\n"I didn\'t lose control (of the chamber). We had an unruly mob," the Associated Press quoted Dewhurst as saying.\nDavis said "my back hurts" after the vote, and added, "I don\'t have a lot of words left."\n"It shows the determination and spirit of Texas women," she told the AP.\nSpectators in the Texas Senate chamber protest a halt to Sen. Wendy Davis\' filibuster against an anti-abortion bill.\nCecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, had said that if the bill passed “abortion would be virtually banned in the state of Texas, and many women could be forced to resort to dangerous and unsafe measures.”\nShe celebrated victory on her Twitter account early Wednesday.\n“Lt. Gov. Dewhurst has agreed that #SB5 [the bill] is dead. The official vote was recorded at 12:03 a.m. Know why? Because of you. #StandWithWendy,” she wrote. “We have started something here that they cannot stop. Thank y\'all.”\nThe measure would have banned abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and would have required all clinics to be graded as surgical centers, with all doctors required to have admitting privileges at hospitals. It\'s estimated that nearly all of the state\'s clinics wouldn\'t have been able to meet the new standards.\nUnlike during famous filibusters in Washington, D.C., when senators talked about anything that came to mind to fill the time, Davis was required to speak nonstop and on topic without sitting down or even leaning on her desk for support.\nShe read the stories of witnesses those who didn\'t get to speak before a Senate committee discussing the measure last week, before moving on to analyzing the bill itself, the Dallas Morning News reported.\nMembers of the gallery cheer and chant as the Texas Senate tried to bring an abortion bill to a vote as time expired late Tuesday.\nBut Republicans won rulings that Davis broke the rules - for getting improper assistance from a colleague who helped her adjust her back brace and for straying from the topic.\nIn a show of support for Davis, President Barack Obama tweeted Tuesday night: "Something special is happening in Austin tonight. #StandWithWendy"\nBut then, late Tuesday night, Davis ran afoul of a three-strikes-and-you\'re-out rule when Dewhurst upheld an objection that she had strayed from the topic again, this time by discussing a 2011 law involving sonograms and abortions, which he ruled was non-germane to the abortion bill.\nThat opened the door for the Senate\'s Republican majority to call for a straight up-or-down vote to end Davis\' remarks. A series of motions, appeals and parliamentary inquiries on that order followed.\nAs midnight neared, raucous cheering and shouts erupted from the gallery during a roll call vote and the disruption - seen on a live video stream of the session - halted Senate action for several minutes, which it was eventually established had prevented the vote.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nRelated:\nThis story was originally published on Tue Jun 25, 2013 10:25 PM EDT\nPopular Discussions

No one under 21 would be able to buy cigarettes in New York City, under a new proposal announced Monday that marks the latest in a decade of moves to crack down on smoking in the nation\'s largest city.\nNew York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn discussed details of a proposed law that would raise the minimum age for tobacco purchases from 18 to 21. City Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley, some of Quinn\'s fellow City Council members and health advocates were to join her.\nUnder federal law, no one under 18 can buy tobacco anywhere in the country, but some states and localities have raised it to 19. Texas lawmakers recently tried to increase the minimum age to 21, but the plan stalled.\nPublic health advocates say a higher minimum age discourages, or at least delays, young people from starting smoking and thereby limits their health risks. But opponents of such measures have said 18-year-olds, legally considered adults, should be able to make their own decisions about whether or not to smoke.\nSome communities, including Needham, Mass., have raised the minimum age to 21, but New York would be the biggest city to do so.\n"With this legislation, we\'ll be targeting the age group at which the overwhelming majority of smokers start," Quinn said.\nOfficials say 80 percent of NYC smokers started before age 21, and an estimated 20,000 New York City public high school students now smoke. While it\'s already illegal for many of them to buy cigarettes, officials say this measure would play a key role by making it illegal for them to turn to slightly older friends to buy smokes for them. The vast majority of people who get asked to do that favor are between 18 and 21 themselves, city officials say.\n"We know that enforcement is never going to be perfect," but this measure should make it "much harder" for teens to get cigarettes, Farley said.\nThe Richmond, Va.-based Altria Group Inc., parent company of Philip Morris USA, which makes the top-selling Marlboro brand, had no immediate comment, said spokesman David Sutton. He previously noted that the company supported federal legislation that in 2009 gave the Food and Drug Administration the power to regulate tobacco products, which includes various retail restrictions.\nUnder Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the health commissioners he has appointed, including Farley, New York has rolled out a slate of anti-smoking initiatives.\nBloomberg, a billionaire who has given $600 million of his own money to anti-smoking efforts around the world, began taking on tobacco use in the city shortly after he became mayor in 2002.\nOver his years in office, the city — at times with the council\'s involvement — helped impose the highest cigarette taxes in the country, barred smoking at parks and on beaches and conducted sometimes graphic advertising campaigns about the hazards of smoking.\nLast month, the Bloomberg administration unveiled a proposal to keep cigarettes out of sight in stores until an adult customer asks for a pack, as well as stopping shops from taking cigarette coupons and honoring discounts.\nBloomberg\'s administration and public health advocates praise the initiatives as bold moves to help people live better. Adult smoking rates in the city have fallen from 21.5 percent in 2002 to 14.8 percent in 2011, Farley has said.\nBut the measures also have drawn complaints, at least initially, that they are nannyish and bad for business.\nSeveral of New York City\'s smoking regulations have survived court challenges. But a federal appeals court said last year that the city couldn\'t force tobacco retailers to display gruesome images of diseased lungs and decaying teeth.\nQuinn, a leading Democratic candidate to succeed Bloomberg next year, has often been perceived as an ally of his.\nBloomberg also has pushed a number of other pioneering public-health measures, such as compelling chain restaurants to post calorie counts on their menus, banning artificial trans fats in restaurants, and attempting to limit the size of sugary drinks. A court struck down the big-beverage rule last month, but the city is appealing and Bloomberg has urged voluntary compliance in the meantime.\nWhile Bloomberg has led the way on many anti-smoking initiatives, this one arose from the City Council, Farley said. City Councilman James Gennaro, who lost his mother to lung cancer after she smoked for decades, has been a particularly strong advocate.\nRelated:\nPopular Discussio

The Arkansas legislature has passed the strictest anti-abortion law in the US, defying the governor\'s warning it would draw the state into a court battle.\nThe bill, one of several anti-abortion measures enacted since Republicans won control of the state legislature in November, bans most abortions after the 12th week of pregnancy.\nThe legislature on Wednesday overrode Democratic Governor Mike Beebe\'s veto.\nAbortion rights supporters plan to sue to stop the law from taking effect.\nThe law, called the Human Heartbeat Protection Act, bans abortions after 12 weeks, when a foetal heartbeat can generally be detected in an ultrasound scan.\n\'Unconstitutional\'?\nThe bill will take effect over the summer unless halted by a court.\n"I\'m just grateful that this body has continued to stand up for the bills that have passed. The eyes of the entire nation were on the Arkansas House of Representatives today," said sponsor Senator Jason Rapert after the state House overrode Gov Beebe\'s veto with a 56-33 vote.\nThe bill would not prosecute women who terminate a pregnancy, but doctors who perform the procedure could have their medical licences revoked.\nThe move comes days after the state legislature voted to override another veto by the governor, this time to push through an immediate ban on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Arkansas and the Center for Reproductive Rights are preparing to file a federal lawsuit challenging the 12-week ban.\n"The whole thing has not only been a slap in the face of Arkansas women but a serious bruising for the state of Arkansas and any efforts it has tried to make to present itself as a progressive, forward-thinking state where people might want to live and work," ACLU of Arkansas Executive Director Rita Sklar told the Arkansas Times.\n"It\'s a giant leap back in time."\nGov Beebe called the law "blatantly unconstitutional" and warned the legislature that a legal battle could be expensive, after he vetoed the measure on Monday.\nThe governor said the bill contradicted the landmark 1973 Supreme Court opinion in the case of Roe v Wade, which ruled abortion was legal until the foetus could survive outside the womb.\nScientists generally agree a foetus becomes viable at about 22 to 24 weeks.\nBoth the 12-week and 20-week laws include exemptions for rape, incest, and cases when the mother\'s life is in danger or the foetus is diagnosed with an extremely serious disorder.

Nathaniel Brooks for The New York Times\nALBANY — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Tuesday unveiled his long-promised Women’s Equality Act, a 10-point plan whose controversial final element, which includes codifying federal abortion rights into state law, could determine the fate of various other antidiscrimination provisions included in the bill.\nThe governor has made the proposal a central part of his plan to reclaim New York’s progressive mantle, and cement his own reputation as a defender of women’s rights, something that could be critical to any presidential bid. But the legislation’s prospects were unclear in the State Senate, which is currently controlled by a coalition of independent Democrats who support abortion rights and Republicans who generally oppose abortion.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, sounded cautiously optimistic about the bill’s chances. “We do not have any assurances,” he said in a news conference attended by about two dozen representatives of women’s groups. “But the language of this bill, I believe, this is a bill that can and should pass.”\nBut Senator Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, the Senate Republican leader, does not plan to consent to bring the abortion portion of the act up for a vote, according to his spokeswoman, Kelly Cummings, though she added that Republicans felt they would come to agreement on all other nine parts of Mr. Cuomo’s plan.\nBecause the Senate’s leadership coalition is new this year, it is not clear whether opposition from the Republican leader on abortion will actually prevent a vote.\nSenator Jeffrey D. Klein, a Bronx Democrat who leads the four-member Independent Democratic Conference that shares control of the Senate, said he supported an even broader plan for women’s rights than the governor’s 10-point act, but also hoped “that abortion does not become a political football used to divide legislators.”\nThe language about abortion in the measure is spare: five sentences at the end of a 59-page bill. The sentences would guarantee a woman’s right to an abortion as established by Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized the procedure. The measure would secure a right to late-term abortions when the health of the pregnant woman is at risk or when the fetus is not viable, as determined by a doctor.\nCurrent state law allows abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy only if the mother’s life is in danger; but the state law is superseded by federal court rulings that allow for late-term abortions to protect a woman’s health.\nIn his announcement, Mr. Cuomo took pains to insist that the abortion element of the act did not expand or extend abortion rights, but simply protected existing rights for New Yorkers in case federal court rulings change. But groups opposed to abortion disagreed in a flurry of statements, including one from Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the Roman Catholic archbishop of New York, who said the governor’s bill “runs the serious risk of broadly expanding abortion access at all stages of gestation.”\nThe inclusion in a single bill of the abortion rights language and less controversial women’s rights provisions was most likely to pose a challenge for some Republicans.\nJessica M. Cherry, counsel to Senator John J. Bonacic, a Hudson Valley Republican who believes abortion should be “safe, legal, and rare,” said Mr. Bonacic, for one, felt the governor should separate the 10 issues out.\nMr. Cuomo said that all 10 points were “vitally important,” and that he — and other members of a coalition of women’s groups who helped devise the legislation — want all 10 passed.\n“I think it will bring clarity and transparency to the people of New York,” the governor said. “They have a right to know how their elected officials feel on each and every one of these 10 points.”\nIn the Assembly, where Democrats have a big majority, the abortion measure is likely to pass. But in the Senate, where Democrats hold a narrow numerical majority but do not have a functional majority, even if the measure came to the floor for a vote, it is not clear what would happen; most but not all Senate Democrats support abortion rights, and most but not all Senate Republicans oppose abortion.

North Carolina\'s House of Representatives passed a restrictive abortion bill Thursday with a 74-41 vote. The bill now heads to the state Senate for approval.\nThe bill would place requirements on clinics that family planning advocates say would make it hard for them to stay in business. Among the requirements is the presence of a doctor when an abortion is being performed.\nThe bill allows North Carolina\'s health department to make temporary new rules for the state\'s 31 abortion clinics as it sees fit.\nIt also prohibits government-administered insurance plans, such as those under the Affordable Care Act, to pay for abortions -- though it makes exceptions when a pregnancy endangers a woman\'s life.\nHouse committee members refashioned a bill on motorcycle safety into one principally about abortion after the state\'s governor threatened on Wednesday to veto the abortion measures. That led the bill to be dubbed the "Motorcycle Abortion Bill."\nWhen legislators attached the abortion measures to the motorcycle safety bill, they placed them at the top of the bill and renamed it "Health and Safety Law Changes." motorcycle safety measures dropped to the bottom of the bill.\nGov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, vowed to veto the abortion legislation the first time it came up.\nIn his campaign, he had promised not to restrict abortion in North Carolina, and abortion-rights advocates lobbied to hold him to his word.\nMcCrory warned in a statement that the legislation was unacceptable without significant changes, but he noted in his objections "that major portions of the bill are of sound (principle) and value."\nThe language of the bill was reworded somewhat the second time around. It now says the health department should make rules without "unduly restricting access."\nMcCrory could still veto, though there are enough conservative votes in the House and Senate to override it.\nA similar but stricter law passed in Mississippi is coming close to shutting down that state\'s last abortion clinic. Another such law passed in Alabama earlier this year.\nThese new state laws represent a broader, nationwide assault on a woman\'s right to choose, said Staci Fox, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman.\n"Bills like these have been introduced in 42 states. This is a whole new level of attack on women\'s health."\nSome of the states that have already passed new laws did so in anticipation of legal challenges and have shored up war chests to fund the battles, she said.\nThey are prepared to go to court, even to challenge the landmark Supreme Court abortion ruling Roe v. Wade that provides the basic legal framework for abortion in the United States.\nAmericans United for Life states: "Using our model legislation and our hard-won expertise with abortion clinic regulations, we also intend to provoke future, strategic \'test cases\' -- federal and state legal challenges to carefully crafted and selected state laws -- that will serve as vehicles to severely undermine Roe v. Wade and, ultimately, eradicate it from American law."

Despite Wendy Davis\' dramatic filibuster delaying Texas\' abortion bill, the Republican-dominated Texas legislature is expected to support the measure which would ban most abortions for women more than 20 weeks pregnant. Just this year, 17 states passed new measures impacting abortion. NBC\'s Kate Snow reports.\nTexas legislators overturned a temporary victory by state Democrats and standard bearer Sen. Wendy Davis, passing a bill late Friday that puts new restrictions on abortion procedures.\nThe bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate just before midnight, two weeks after the Legislature failed to put the restrictions to a successful vote in its first special session. The bill would ban most abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy, place new requirements on which facilities could perform the procedures and limit a woman’s ability to induce an abortion by taking a pill.\nAbortion rights advocates, including Planned Parenthood of Texas, have said that the new law would effectively shut down all but six of the facilities where abortions are performed in the state.\nPro- and anti-abortion activists flooded the Texas Capitol on Friday afternoon, setting the stage for a dramatic ideological showdown. Abortion rights advocates wearing orange were holding gynecological devices and signs, while anti-abortion advocates dressed in blue carried images of fetuses and Bible verses, according to The Associated Press.\nTwenty-one amendments were offered, debated and rejected. As debate progressed, reporters inside the chamber said protesters could be heard chanting outside, and some protesters who were in the gallery were removed after outbursts.\nAs the time ticked toward midnight, senators offered passionate arguments on either side.\nGov. Rick Perry had made passing House Bill 2 a priority and said he will sign it into law.\nIn a statement after the bill passed, Perry said: This legislation builds on the strong and unwavering commitment we have made to defend life and protect women\'s health. I am proud of our lawmakers, and citizens who tirelessly defended our smallest and most vulnerable Texans and future Texans."\nDemocrats in the legislature have said that while there was little they could do to keep the bill from passing, they plan to challenge it in federal court.\n“We do not have the numbers to stop it,” said Democratic Sen. Royce West of Dallas, according to The Associated Press. “As soon as it’s signed by the governor, it will be challenged … we believe the whole bill is unconstitutional.”\nTexas is only one of several states looking to tighten rules for abortions.\nNorth Carolina\'s House passed a bill Thursday that directs state regulators to change standards for abortion clinics to bring them in line with more regulated outpatient surgical centers.\nMissouri\'s governor Friday let a bill become law without his signature that requires doctors to be in the room for the initial dose of a drug used in medication abortions.\nWisconsin’s governor signed into law last week a measure similar to Texas\' that forces abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. That law was blocked by a federal judge.\nThe biggest fireworks have come in Texas. Last month, GOP lawmakers were prevented from carrying out a vote on House Bill 2 as their first special session came to an end after Davis delivered an 11-hour filibuster that was cut short when state senators ruled she had committed three rules infractions. Raucous protests from Davis supporters in the gallery prevented lawmakers from carrying out a valid vote on the bill.\nSecurity was tightened before the final vote Friday. Dozens of state troopers surrounded the gallery and monitored the hallways Friday, according to the AP.\nTroopers inspected bags of people streaming into the halls of the capitol. Senate Sergeant-At-Arms Rick DeLeon said no props would be permitted in the gallery, including tampons, perfume bottles, and moisturizers, the AP reported.\nSen. Kirk Watson of Austin, the leader of the legislature’s Democrats, said he stepped in to prevent troopers from confiscating feminine hygiene products from women hoping to view the debate, according to the AP.\nThe fight over the bill has drawn national attention from abortion rights advocates disturbed by the spread of new restrictions, as well as anti-abortion activists who say the new law would protect the health of mothers and fetuses.\nFormer contender for the GOP presidential nomination Rick Santorum appeared in Austin on Thursday, and said that “Texas is the center of the pro-life debate in the country right now,” according to Reuters.\nRelated:\nThis story was originally published on Sat Jul 13, 2013 1:31 AM EDT\nPopular Discussions

The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to block controversial Texas abortion restrictions that have been called some of the strictest in the country and have led a dozen abortion clinics in the state to stop performing the procedure.\nThe court by a 5-4 vote denied a request by Planned Parenthood to block a ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, allowing key parts of the Texas abortion law to stay in effect while the lawsuit challenging the restrictions moves forward.\nThe four liberal justices who voted in favor of the request said they would have overturned the appeals court\'s Oct. 31 ruling that allowed the law to take effect.\nIn its 20-page ruling, the panel of appeals court judges acknowledged that the law\'s provision requiring doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital "may increase the cost of accessing an abortion provider and decrease the number of physicians available to perform abortions."\nHowever, the panel said that the U.S. Supreme Court has held that having "the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate" a law that serves a valid purpose, "one not designed to strike at the right itself." The provision has led at least 12 clinics in the state to stop performing abortions since the ruling.\nA spokeswoman for the Texas Attorney General\'s Office said Tuesday said the office is "pleased" with the Supreme Court\'s ruling.\n"These are commonsense - and perfectly constitutional - regulations that further the state\'s interest in protecting the health and safety of Texas women," Lauren Bean said.\nRepublican Texas Gov. Rick Perry also said he was happy with the court\'s decision.\n"This is good news both for the unborn and for the women of Texas, who are now better protected from shoddy abortion providers operating in dangerous conditions," Perry said.\nThe appeals court panel left in place a portion of a previous judge\'s order that prevents the state from enforcing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration protocol for abortion-inducing drugs in cases where the woman is between 50 and 63 days into her pregnancy. Doctors testifying before the court had said such women would be harmed if the protocol were enforced.\nThe appeals court\'s order is temporary until it can hold a complete hearing, likely in January.\nThe restrictions gained notoriety when Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis launched a nearly 13-hour filibuster against them in June.\nThe law also bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and beginning in October 2014 requires doctors to perform all abortions in surgical facilities.\nDuring the trial, officials for one chain of abortion clinics testified that they\'ve tried to obtain admitting privileges for their doctors at 32 hospitals, but so far only 15 accepted applications and none have announced a decision.\nMany hospitals with religious affiliations will not allow abortion doctors to work there, while others fear protests if they provide privileges.\nMany have requirements that doctors live within a certain radius of the facility, or perform a minimum number of surgeries a year that must be performed in a hospital.\nFox News\' Shannon Bream and The Associated Press contributed to this report

WASHINGTON — Despite strong resistance from religious organizations, the Obama administration said Friday that it was moving ahead with a rule requiring most employers to provide free insurance coverage of contraceptives for women, a decision that has touched off a legal and political battle likely to rage for another year.\nThe final rule, issued under the new health care law, adopts a simplified version of an approach proposed by the government in February to balance the interests of women with the concerns of the Roman Catholic Church and other employers with religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptives.\nAfter considering more than 400,000 comments, administration officials refused to budge on the basic principle. The rule, they said, is very similar to their proposal. An exemption is included for churches. But many Catholic hospitals, schools, universities and other religious institutions will have to take steps so that coverage is available to employees and their dependents.\nThe issue figured prominently in last year’s elections as President Obama and other Democrats pressed their advantage with female voters. At the same time, Catholic bishops waged a national campaign arguing that the federal policy infringed on religious freedom and violated the church’s social and moral teachings on birth control and abortion.\nCardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the group was reviewing the final rule.\nDemocrats describe the mandate for coverage of birth control as one of the chief benefits of the 2010 health care law, a boon to women and their health.\n“The health care law guarantees millions of women access to recommended preventive services at no cost,” said Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services. “Today’s announcement reinforces our commitment to respect the concerns of houses of worship and other nonprofit religious organizations that object to contraceptive coverage, while helping to ensure that women get the care they need, regardless of where they work.”\nRepublicans say the requirement shows how intrusive and onerous the law is.\nThe rule does not satisfy the concerns of certain religious organizations or businesses whose owners have religious objections to contraceptive coverage.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, said Thursday that the owners of Hobby Lobby, a craft store chain that describes itself as “a faith-based company,” could pursue their case against the rule.\nEric C. Rassbach, a deputy general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has represented plaintiffs in that case and others challenging the law, said the final rule did nothing to meet the objections of his clients.\n“The government tinkered with some mechanisms in the rule, but did not really get at the religious conscience questions,” Mr. Rassbach said. “So there is a fundamental conflict that will have to be resolved in court.”\nUnder the rule, women are to have access to contraceptives without any premium, deductible, co-payment or other fees.\nSome religious employers do not want their employees to have coverage of contraceptives, even if someone else pays for it.\nA number of federal judges deferred decisions until the White House issued a final regulation. Publication of the rule clears the way for courts to act.\nUnder the new health care law, employers with more than 50 employees will generally be required to offer health insurance to employees, or the employers will be subject to financial penalties.\nAmong the “essential health benefits” that must be provided are preventive services. In particular, the administration says, most health plans must cover sterilization and the full range of contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including emergency contraceptive pills, like those known as ella and Plan B One-Step.\nUnder the rule issued Friday, the government said certain “religious employers” — primarily houses of worship — may exclude contraceptive coverage from their health plans for employees and their dependents. In effect, they will be exempt from the federal requirement to provide contraceptive coverage.\nThe rule also lays out what it describes as an accommodation for other nonprofit religious and church-affiliated organizations, like hospitals, universities and charities, that object to contraceptive coverage but do not qualify for the exemption.\nUnder the rule, these organizations will not have to contract, arrange or pay for contraceptive coverage to which they object on religious grounds.\nInstead, the administration said, such coverage will be “separately provided to women enrolled in their health plans at no cost.”\nUnder this arrangement, a nonprofit religious employer must notify its insurer that it objects to contraceptive coverage. The insurer must then notify people in the health plan that it will arrange or pay for contraceptive services as long as they remain in the health plan.\nMany employers serve as their own insurers and hire outside companies to administer benefits and pay claims. In such cases, the administration said, the “third-party administrator” must inform people in an employer-sponsored health plan that it is “providing or arranging separate no-cost payments for contraceptive services.”\nAdministration officials said the cost of contraceptive services would, for insurers, be offset by savings that result from the fact that women would be healthier and will have fewer births.\nTo reimburse third-party administrators for the cost of contraceptive services, the government said it would reduce the fees charged to certain health insurance companies for the privilege of selling insurance in federal marketplaces, or exchanges, being established in more than 30 states. Insurers will then be required to share some of those savings with third-party administrators for the self-insured health plans of religious employers that object to contraceptive coverage.\nThe reduction in user fees would reflect the cost of contraceptive services, as well as “an allowance for administrative costs and margin,” or profit. The government would require third-party administrators to provide detailed information about the payments they made or arranged.\nFederal officials had difficulty explaining how these arrangements would work in practice. They said they were leaving the details to employers, insurers and third-party administrators.\nThe Labor Department said it had the authority to require third-party administrators to provide, or arrange for an insurance company or other entity to provide, payment for contraceptive services.\nThe final rule is the administration’s fourth attempt in 20 months to articulate a policy requiring contraceptive coverage.\nSenator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said: “Today’s ruling strikes a fair balance between religious liberties and the reproductive rights of all women. Access to contraception shouldn’t be dictated by a woman’s employer.”\nBut Patrick J. Reilly, president of the Cardinal Newman Society, which promotes Catholic education, said the final rule did not respect the religious freedom of religious employers. “Now the lawsuits can proceed,” he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Reproductive-rights groups that sued the Food and Drug Administration over access to the “morning-after” pill will ask a judge to hold the agency in contempt if it fails to comply with a court order directing it to make emergency contraception available to women of all ages.\nThe FDA said on Tuesday it will allow girls as young as 15 years old to buy without a prescription the Plan B One-Step emergency contraceptive, made by a unit of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\nThe groups, which include the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund, said the FDA must remove all age limits and point-of-sale restrictions on emergency contraception, also known as the “morning-after” pill, by Monday.\nIf not, they said they would ask a federal judge in Brooklyn to hold the agency in contempt of an April 5 order giving the FDA 30 days to make emergency contraception available over-the-counter to girls of all ages.\nThe FDA could also seek to temporarily stop the court order from taking effect if it files an appeal. It has not done so yet, and the FDA said on Tuesday that the Department of Justice was considering its options.\nThe ruling from District Judge Edward Korman came in response to a lawsuit originally filed in 2005 by the reproductive-rights groups.\nA spokeswoman for the FDA declined to comment Wednesday.\nThe dispute is the latest twist in a long legal battle over the morning-after pill that has sparked both political and religious debates. If taken up to 120 hours after unprotected sex, it is designed to prevent pregnancy.\nThe FDA said Tuesday’s decision was made in response by an administrative petition from Teva Women’s Health, a unit of the Israeli, drug-maker Teva, and was unrelated to Korman’s ruling.\nThe agency said its decision to lower the age limit for Plan B One-Step was based on scientific data submitted by Teva that showed girls as young as 15 could safely use the drug without the intervention of a healthcare provider. Cashiers will still have to verify the customer’s age before selling it, the FDA said.\nNancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement, that the FDA’s decision “does nothing to address the significant barriers that far too many women of all ages will still find if they arrive at the drugstore without identification or after the pharmacy gates have been closed for the night or weekend.”

A federal judge has put one of the strictest abortion laws in the country on hold. NBC\'s Pete Williams reports.\nIn a stunning move, a federal judge Monday ruled that abortion restrictions authorized by Texas lawmakers in July are unconstitutional, and will not be implemented as scheduled on Tuesday, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.\nU.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel decided Monday that the regulations requiring abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital impeded on the rights of physicians to do what they judge is best for their patients and would unreasonably limit a woman\'s access to state abortion clinics.\n"The admitting-privileges provision of House Bill 2 does not bear a rational relationship to the legitimate right of the state in preserving and promoting fetal life or a woman\'s health and, in any event, places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus and is thus an undue burden to her," Yeakel wrote in his decision.\nAlthough Yeakel ruled that Texas could regulate how a doctor prescribes an abortion-inducing pill, he said the law did not allow for a doctor to alter treatment taken in order to best safeguard the health of the woman taking it.\nTherefore, he barred the provision of the law mandating that doctors abide the Food and Drug Administration’s procedure for drugs in all cases, according to the Associated Press.\nHe wrote: "The medication abortion provision may not be enforced against any physician who determines, in appropriate medical judgment, to perform the medication-abortion using off-label protocol for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.”\nTwo other contentious provisions of the law — a prohibition on abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and a requirement beginning in October 2014 that doctors perform all abortions in surgical facilities — are still slated to take effect, according to the AP.\nYeakel\'s decision comes four months after Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis, now a candidate for governor, staged a dramatic 13-hour filibuster against the proposed restrictions, widely considered among the most stringent in the country.\nThe filibuster forced Gov. Rick Perry to order a second special legislative session for the Republican-dominated Legislature to pass the controversial law.\nIn a statement, Davis said she was “not surprised by the judge’s ruling.”\n“As a mother, I would rather see our tax dollars spent on improving our kid’s schools rather than defending this law,” she said.\nLast week, Yeakel heard three days of testimony and oral arguments in Austin about the hot-button law, which opponents and abortion-rights advocates had sued to prevent from taking effect.\nThose opponents, including lawyers for Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, contended that the rule that doctors have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the abortion clinic would force a third of the clinics in the state to shutter.\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry addresses attendees of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation\'s Defending the American Dream Summit in Orlando, Fla., Aug. 30.\nThe Texas attorney general\'s office, on the other hand, contended that the restrictions protect women and the life of the fetus.\nAttorney General Greg Abbott was widely expected to file an emergency appeal of Yeakel\'s order to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, according to the AP. Abbott, a Republican, is also running for governor.\nIn a statement, Gov. Perry said that Monday’s ruling “will not stop our ongoing efforts to protect life and ensure the women of our state aren\'t exposed to any more of the abortion-mill horror stories that have made headlines recently. We will continue fighting to implement the laws passed by the duly-elected officials of our state, laws that reflect the will and values of Texans.”\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nRelated:\nPopular Discussions

From Joan\'s earlier piece on South Carolina\'s expanding Medicaid rolls:\nMedicaid rolls in South Carolina will grow by about 162,000 people by the middle of 2015. Had the state expanded Medicaid, another 340,000 people would get coverage. As it is, at least many more children will be covered, and their parents will probably find out in the process that if their governor hadn\'t been such an asshole, they would have coverage, too.\nEven in South Carolina, a state hostile to Obamacare expansion, hundreds of thousands of people are benefiting just from greater awareness of existing government programs for which they do qualify. And while most of those beneficiaries are children, those children have families who would appreciate access to similar services, if only Republicans would get out of the way.\nBut South Carolina is solidly Red, right? Romney won the state by 11 points, right? So it doesn\'t matter! Except that in raw totals, Romney won by around 204,000 votes. And Republicans assume (perhaps rightly) that every Obamacare beneficiary will become much more favorable toward the government. And if you start thinking government can help you, Republicans don\'t stand a chance.\nSo for the them, it\'s bad enough that nearly 200,000 South Carolina residents (mostly children) will soon be part of their so-called "culture of dependency". That alone has potentially negative electoral ramifications. But had South Carolina taken federal dollars to give another 340,000 of its residents access to low-cost health services, their entire GOP\'s existence would be imperiled.\nThat\'s why Republicans continue to fight tooth and nail against Obamacare, from seeking its repeal to sabotaging its rollout. It\'s an existential crisis. The more people benefit, the harder it will be for them to argue that government is irreparably broken and must be drowned in Grover Norquist\'s bathtub.

WASHINGTON — Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Tuesday temporarily blocked the Obama administration from forcing some religious-affiliated groups to provide health insurance coverage of birth control or face penalties as part of the Affordable Care Act.\nActing at the request of an order of nuns in Colorado, Justice Sotomayor issued the stay just hours before the requirement was to go into effect on New Year’s Day. She gave the Obama administration until Friday to respond to the Supreme Court.\nJustice Sotomayor’s order applies to the nuns, the Little Sisters of the Poor, and other Roman Catholic nonprofit groups that use the same health plan, known as the Christian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust. The groups’ lawsuit is one of many challenging the federal requirement for contraceptive coverage, but a decision on the merits of that case by the full Supreme Court could have broader implications.\n“We are delighted with the ruling,” said Mark L. Rienzi, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, who represented the nuns in the lawsuit. “We are delighted that the Supreme Court will require the government to file briefs in the court on this matter.” The Little Sisters of the Poor operate nursing homes for low-income people in the United States and around the world.\nWithout Justice Sotomayor’s order, the nuns “would have been forced to comply with the contraceptive mandate on Wednesday or face large fines,” Mr. Rienzi said late Tuesday.\nThe contraception requirement has been one of the most controversial aspects of the health law since the Obama administration first announced it in mid-2011, along with other requirements it characterized as preventive care. Religious opponents of abortion have objected especially strongly to the requirement to provide emergency contraception pills, like Plan B, although most studies show that the drug works by preventing fertilization, not by inducing abortion.\nIn an effort to compromise, the administration said that women who work for nonprofit religious groups that object to birth control could receive separate coverage not paid for by the employers. It refused, however, to offer accommodations to secular businesses whose owners have religious objections to contraception.\nThat has led to a separate group of lawsuits. And last month, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a pair of cases on whether corporations may refuse to provide insurance coverage for contraception.\nJustice Sotomayor — who later was to lead the countdown for the Times Square ball drop — issued her order after the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, earlier on New Year’s Eve denied the nuns’ request for a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the contraceptive coverage requirements imposed by the new health care law.\nThe Obama administration had argued that the Little Sisters of the Poor could opt out of the contraceptive coverage requirement by completing “a self-certification form” and providing it to the entity that administers their health benefits. Therefore, the Justice Department said, the contraceptive mandate imposes “no substantial burden on their exercise of religion.”\n“To opt out of providing contraceptive coverage, Little Sisters need only certify that they are nonprofit organizations that hold themselves out as religious and that, because of religious objections, they are opposed to providing coverage for some or all contraceptive services,” the Justice Department told the appeals court on Monday.\nThe administration says it has exempted churches from the contraceptive coverage requirement and offered an accommodation to certain religious nonprofit groups. But the Becket Fund argued that “the ‘accommodation’ still forces the Little Sisters to find an insurer who will cover sterilization, contraceptive and abortion-inducing drugs and devices.”\n“The Sisters would also be required to sign a form that triggers the start of that coverage,” it said. “In good conscience, they cannot do that. So the ‘accommodation’ still violates their religious beliefs.”\nThe Obama administration has repeatedly defended the birth control requirement. “The president believes that no one, including the government or for-profit corporations, should be able to dictate those decisions to women,” Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said last month.\nOne of the pending Supreme Court cases was filed by Hobby Lobby, a corporation owned by a family whose members have said they try to run the business on Christian principles. The company, which operates a chain of arts-and-crafts stores and has more than 15,000 full-time employees of many faiths. Hobby Lobby has said it has no problem with offering coverage for many forms of contraception, including condoms, diaphragms, sponges, several kinds of birth control pills and sterilization surgery. But drugs and devices that can prevent embryos from implanting in the womb are another matter, and make it complicit in a form of abortion, the company said.\nThe other case was filed by the Conestoga Wood Specialties Corporation, which makes wood cabinets and is owned by a Mennonite family that had similar objections to the law.
