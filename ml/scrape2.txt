WASHINGTON — Retired astronaut Mark Kelly, husband of former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, recently purchased an assault weapon to make a point about the ease of background checks for gun owners.\nIn an interview with CNN on Monday, Kelly said his experience highlights the availability of such weapons. "It is a pretty easy thing to do," he said about buying the military-style firearm.\nKelly announced Friday on his Facebook page that he bought an AR-15, one of the 157 military-style weapons that would be banned under a bill pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The panel is set to consider three gun bills Tuesday, including the proposed assault weapons ban authored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.\nHe told CNN that he wanted "firsthand knowledge" of gun issues. Kelly said he plans to buy a weapon at a gun show and to sell a weapon and will write about those experiences as well.\n"Even to buy an assault weapon, the background check only takes a few minutes," Kelly said on Facebook. "Scary to think of people buying guns like these without a background check at a gun show or the Internet. We really need to close the gun show and private seller loophole."\nKelly, a retired Navy captain, and Giffords are both gun owners who have been outspoken about the need for new gun-control measures. Americans for Responsible Solutions, their super PAC, has been running ads featuring Giffords that tout the proposed assault weapons ban and universal background checks.\nKelly said on his Facebook page and in the TV interview that he plans to give the AR-15 to the Tucson Police Department when he receives the weapon. He said he will keep a .45-caliber handgun he purchased at the same time.\nGiffords was shot in the head in January 2011 in a Tucson rampage that left six people dead. President Obama and others have pushed for new gun legislation in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., in December that left 20 students and six of their educators dead.

BRISTOL, Florida (Reuters) - A Florida sheriff was acquitted on Thursday of charges that he committed misconduct and falsified public records when he freed a jailed man who carried a loaded gun without a permit.\nSuspended Liberty County Sheriff Nick Finch, with his wife Angela (C) and daughter Amber (R), talks with reporters on the steps of the courthouse after his acquittal on charges of official misconduct and falsifying official documents in Tallahassee, Florida October 31, 2013. REUTERS/Bill Cotterell\nSuspended Liberty County Sheriff Nick Finch, 51, had testified that he released Floyd Parrish from jail because he had a constitutional duty to uphold the Second Amendment right to bear arms.\nConservative organizations and activists opposed to gun control rallied to the sheriff’s defense after Governor Rick Scott suspended him last summer. Scott reinstated him shortly after the jury delivered its verdict.\nA now-former deputy had arrested Parrish during a traffic stop in March on charges of carrying a loaded weapon without permit.\nParrish, 58, testified during the four-day trial that he kept a pistol in his pocket to summon help if he passed out at his rural home because of various health conditions.\nAt the county jail, Finch advised him to get a permit soon, and let him go.\nProsecutors did not contend that Finch lacked authority to release Parrish or to overrule the deputy’s decision to arrest him. Assistant State Attorney Jack Campbell argued that the sheriff, who was elected last year in a bitterly fought campaign, was repaying Parrish and his brothers for their political support.\nHe said Finch was “using the Constitution to cover up his criminality” and that he broke the law by removing Parrish’s booking records and arrest report from the jail.\nDefense attorney Jimmy Judkins told jurors that Finch was just being neighborly and abiding by the social customs of the rural Florida Panhandle.\n“There ain’t many of y’all, but you have your own common code or beliefs,” Judkins said. “It’s a way of life over here for people to own guns ... There’s a distinct possibility that, every now and then, one of y’all is going to make a mistake and he doesn’t want to create a convicted felon out of an incident that could be misunderstood.”\nThe defense lawyer said Finch had no corrupt intent in freeing Parrish. He said no one knew who “whited out” a jail log entry or removed the arrest affidavit but that computer records and property documents still existed to show Parrish had been in custody for about three hours.\nProsecutors belatedly worked out a deal to defer prosecution of Parrish on the gun charge, in exchange for his paying $200 in costs and doing 50 hours of community service.\nThe deputy who made the arrest testified that when he learned of Parish’s release, he went to the jail and retrieved his own copy of the arrest papers.\nAfter lining up another job, he reported the incident to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which investigated and charged Finch in July with official misconduct and illegally altering public records.

The Washington Post:\nLife does go on, through Columbine in 1999, through Virginia Tech in 2007, through Sandy Hook in 2012. Each atrocity provides a jolt to the nation and then recedes with little effect, until the next unimaginable event occurs, except each time a little more imaginable. Everything was supposed to change after a man with a semiautomatic weapon mowed down 20 elementary school children in their classrooms last December. But for the politicians, nothing changed. Now, another massacre, another roster of funerals. Again, again, again.\nRobin Abcarian at The Los Angeles Times:\nThere is no mass shooting devastating enough, disgusting enough or shocking enough that the U.S. Congress would be moved to enact reasonable gun legislation like the measures proposed in April by President Obama after 20 first-graders were mowed down last year in Newtown, Conn. [...]\nAnd, as it turns out, when you are the NRA or in its pocket, there is never a "right time" to talk about rational gun measures.\nSo here we are again, another mass shooting in the news, another moment when gun control advocates must once again lean into the fray and not allow themselves be intimidated by people who would rather offer a prayer for the dead than do anything to prevent more killing.\nDavid Frum:\nI write on the day of the killing. Gun enthusiasts say it is inappropriate to talk about gun violence at the time it occurs. Better to wait … and wait … and wait … until time has passed, and the weeping next of kin have vanished from TV, and it’s safe to return to business as usual. The idea of the gun enthusiasts is that the way to show respect for the victims of gun violence is to do everything possible to multiply their number.\nYet the gun enthusiasts do have one point on their side: for all the horror of these massacres, they are only a small part of the story of gun violence in America. Most casualties of gun violence will not die at the hands of a mentally disturbed killer seeking random victims. Most gun casualties occur in the course of quarrels and accidents between people who would be described as “law-abiding, responsible gun owners” up until the moment that they lost their temper or left a weapon where a four-year-old could find it and kill himself or his sister.\nHead below the fold for more analysis on this tragedy.\nSubtract the military setting and the backdrop of the nation\'s capital, and you have a tragically common event: workplace homicide. Nobody shows up for work anticipating a spray of gunfire into the employee cafeteria. But homicides account for 1 out of 10 fatal on-the-job injuries, according to a 2010 study by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. [...]\nEighty percent of those homicides involved guns. The shooters included robbers, estranged partners and angry clients; co-workers or former co-workers accounted for only 12 percent. [...]\nPolice in Washington haven\'t volunteered a motive in the Navy Yard carnage. There\'s no evidence of terrorism, they say, but they haven\'t ruled it out. In the end, like so many workplace attacks, it could well be attributed to two things: A lethal grudge. And a gun.\nThe Washington Post\'s Eugene Robinson:\nOpponents of gun control argue that, instead of infringing Second Amendment rights, we should focus on the fact that most, if not all, of these mass shooters are psychologically disturbed. But many of the officials who take this view are simultaneously trying their best to repeal Obamacare, which will provide access to mental health services to millions of Americans who are now uninsured.\nSo what difference did it really make what motivated Monday’s shooting? Beyond tightening security at military bases, what is our sclerotic political system capable of doing to prevent the next slaughter of innocents?\nThe Hartford Courant:\nJust five months ago, a mile and a half away at the U.S. Capitol, the U.S. Senate defeated a compromise proposal to expand background checks on gun purchases, despite vast public support for the proposal.\nThe gun control proposals had followed the horrific massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December, where a deranged gunman killed 20 children and six educators before taking his own life. The Senate proposal would have required background checks for sales at gun shows and the Internet, closing glaring loopholes in current law.\nIs there a place in America that hasn\'t been touched by a mass shooting? Has it become part of life in this country? About 3,000 people, military and civilian, work in the building where the shooting took place. We ask for senators who voted against the gun control bill to go down there tomorrow and look them in the eye.

Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband former astronaut Mark Kelly had lunch today with former President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara at their Kennebunkport, Maine home, Giffords spokeswoman Pia Carusone tells ABC News.\nGiffords and Kelly are on their seven-day seven-state "Rights and Responsibilities Tour," to push for expanded background checks for firearms purchases. They are also being accompanied by some families of victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting who were with them Friday evening in New Hampshire and today in Maine.\nThis isn\'t the first time Giffords and Bush have met. When Giffords was recovering in a Houston hospital, Bush and his wife Barbara went to visit her. In her 2011 memoir with Kelly, they write that at that point in her recovery she could only say "chicken" to the former president and first lady.\nBush has an interesting history with gun control himself. In 1989, then President George H. W. Bush issued an executive order halting the importation of some semi-automatic firearms after a mass shooting that killed five children and wounded 29 others in California in January 1989. The shooter used an AK-47 assault rifle.\nIn 1995, the former president resigned from the National Rifle Association after the NRA compared agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to "Nazis" who harass gun owners.\n"Your broadside against federal agents deeply offends my own sense of decency and honor, and it offends my concept of service to country," Bush wrote in a letter to the NRA president Thomas Washington on May 3, 1995. "It indirectly slurs a wide array of government law-enforcement officials, who are out there, day and night, laying their lives on the line for all of us."\nIn a fundraising letter at the time NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre, who still holds that title, described federal agents as "wearing Nazi bucket helmets and black storm trooper uniforms" and wanting to "attack law-abiding citizens," which Bush called "vicious slander on good people."

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut lawmakers announced a deal Monday on what they called some of the toughest gun laws in the country that were proposed after the December mass shooting in the state, including a ban on new high-capacity ammunition magazines like the ones used in the massacre that left 20 children and six educators dead.\nThe proposal includes new registration requirements for existing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets, something of a disappointment for some family members of Newtown victims who wanted an outright ban on the possession of all high-capacity magazines and traveled to the state Capitol on Monday to ask lawmakers for it.\nThe package also creates what lawmakers said is the nation\'s first statewide dangerous weapon offender registry, creates a new "ammunition eligibility certificate," imposes immediate universal background checks for all firearms sales, and extends the state\'s assault weapons ban to 100 new types of firearms and requires that a weapon have only one of several features in order to be banned.\nThe newly banned weapons could no longer be bought or sold in Connecticut, and those legally owned already would have to be registered with the state, just like the high-capacity magazines.\n"No gun owner will lose their gun," said House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero Jr., a Norwalk Republican. "No gun owner will lose their magazines."\nThe bill also addresses mental health and school security measures.\nThe shooting Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School reignited the gun debate in the country and led to calls for increased gun control legislation on the federal and state levels. While some other states, including neighboring New York, have strengthened their gun laws, momentum has stalled in Congress, whose members were urged by President Barack Obama last week not to forget the shooting and to capitalize on the best chance in years to stem gun violence.\nConnecticut should be seen as an example for lawmakers elsewhere, said Senate President Donald E. Williams Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat.

The grieving mother of a 6-year-old killed in the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School joined Illinois Democrats on Sunday in calling for a statewide ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines.\n"In Newtown, we learned the brutal truth about the devastation that high-capacity magazines can cause," said Hockley inside the Thompson Center in downtown Chicago.\nHockley, who was joined by fellow Newtown parents Mark Barden and Francine Wheeler, said the proposed law — Senate Bill 1002 — could save innocent lives.\nAdam Lanza, 20, who stormed Sandy Hook and killed 27 people there, including himself, fired 154 bullets in less than five minutes, officials said. He deliberately chose to carry 30-round magazines instead of smaller magazines to kill as many people as possible, Hockley said.\n"If he needed to reload more often, how many other children might be alive today from both classrooms?" Hockley asked. "Maybe Dylan would still be alive."\nThat sentiment was shared by the other Newtown parents at the news conference with Gov. Pat Quinn. Wheeler pointed out that 11 children were able to escape Lanza while he reloaded.\n"Not my son Ben," Wheeler said, as she paused to compose herself, "but other precious children are alive today because magazine size makes a difference."\nQuinn, Senate President John Cullerton, D-Chicago, and Sen. Dan Kotowski, D-Park Ridge, joined the parents in calling on state legislators to pass the bill banning the delivery and sale of ammunition magazines that contain more than 10 rounds.\nUnder that legislation, introduced Friday by Kotowski, the sale or delivery of these magazines would be punishable by a maximum of three years in prison. It would also make the use of a high-capacity magazine during a crime an aggravating factor leading to a stiffer penalty, Kotowski said.\nKotowski carried a stuffed teddy bear to the event. After the tragedy in Newtown, people across the country mailed teddy bears to Connecticut as a way to express sympathy.\n"What I found ironic about this, tragically ironic, is that teddy bears face more stringent regulations than guns do in our country," Kotowski said. "Teddy bears are tested for sharp edges, points, loose parts and flammability. And you know the number of children who were killed by teddy bears in our country last year?"\nOpponents of bills to ban high-capacity magazines said those measures would be ineffective in stopping criminals who don\'t obey guns laws from killing people.\nThe measure will need 30 votes in the Senate and 60 votes in the House to pass in the next 12 days, Quinn said. The governor said he hopes that, in passing the bill, the legislature will send a message against gun violence.\n"There is a passage in Scripture that says if you save one life, you save the whole world," Quinn said. "That\'s what we\'re here to do today and tomorrow and this whole next 12 days."\n"I refuse to let one faction, the National Rifle Association, dictate a response that benefits their interests while silencing the voices of victims," he said.\nCullerton said he expected the vote on this issue, as well as another measure before the Senate regarding concealed carry restrictions, to be "very close."\nAfter the news conference, the Newtown parents said they are struggling to understand why a bill that would limit the size of ammunition magazines faces a struggle for passage.\n"Because it\'s common sense. It\'s not taking away guns from anybody. It\'s nothing about banning. There\'s nothing about confiscation. Everyone\'s rights are protected," Hockley said. "This is just about limiting the number of bullets a magazine can hold. We look at hunters\' rules, where there are limits to the amount of bullets that a shotgun or handgun can hold when shooting game. We don\'t quite understand why humans can\'t be afforded that same right."\n"It comes down to simple math," he said. "In a mass shooting when the shooter has to stop shooting and he\'s preoccupied with reloading, that\'s an opportunity for people to stop him."

More\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Rifle Association is using a Justice Department memo it obtained to argue in ads that the Obama administration believes its gun control plans won\'t work unless the government seizes firearms and requires national gun registration — ideas the White House has not proposed and does not support.\nThe NRA\'s assertion and its obtaining of the memo in the first place underscore the no-holds-barred battle under way as Washington\'s fight over gun restrictions heats up.\nThe memo, under the name of one of the Justice Department\'s leading crime researchers, critiques the effectiveness of gun control proposals, including some of President Barack Obama\'s. A Justice Department official called the memo an unfinished review of gun violence research and said it does not represent administration policy.\nThe memo says requiring background checks for more gun purchases could help, but also could lead to more illicit weapons sales. It says banning assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines produced in the future but exempting those already owned by the public, as Obama has proposed, would have limited impact because people now own so many of those items.\nIt also says that even total elimination of assault weapons would have little overall effect on gun killings because assault weapons account for a limited proportion of those crimes.\nThe nine-page document says the success of universal background checks would depend in part on "requiring gun registration," and says gun buybacks would not be effective "unless massive and coupled with a ban."\nThe administration has not proposed gun registration, buybacks or banning all firearms. But gun registration and ownership curbs are hot-button issues for the NRA and other gun-rights groups, which strenuously oppose the ideas.\nWhether to require record-keeping for private gun sales is holding up a congressional compromise on legislation to expand background checks, now required only for transactions by federally licensed dealers, according to people familiar with bipartisan Senate talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.

— Grieving parents of children killed at a Connecticut elementary school gave haunting testimony about their lost sons Monday as they tried to persuade the Illinois Senate to approve a ban on the sale of high-capacity gun magazines in Illinois.\nThe parents\' emotion injected a palpable measure of heartache into the rough-and-tumble Illinois gun debate, where jockeying over how to put together a concealed carry law has drawn most of the headlines.\nThe bill considered Monday would limit the sale or delivery of a gun magazine to no more than 10 bullets. It advanced 12-3 but faces an uncertain fate in the full Senate amid the objections of gun manufacturers and the National Rifle Association.\nMark Barden, whose son, Daniel, was slain at Sandy Hook Elementary School, called it "my duty" to testify, saying he wished no other family had to go through the "pain of losing a child."\nHe and Nicole Hockley, the mother of another shooting victim, told the Senate Executive Committee that the Connecticut killer used 30-round magazines that allowed him to get off more shots. They said several children escaped while the shooter paused, but he killed 26 children and educators in about four minutes before killing himself.\nHockley gazed down at the witness table at a card with a picture of her late son, Dylan. She called up another picture on her iPad before she testified that Sandy Hook parents "learned the brutal truth" of what happens when a killer chooses a high-capacity magazine to achieve the "best kill rate as possible."\nSponsoring Sen. Dan Kotowski, D-Park Ridge, said the idea of his bill is to "minimize the damage" the magazines can cause. He called the legislation a "perfect blend" of gun rights and public safety. When a gunman uses a high-capacity magazine, "you have real-life, dead bodies," Kotowski said.\nBut National Rifle Association lobbyist Todd Vandermyde questioned whether the measure would pass constitutional muster. Vandermyde said public officials are protected by police carrying guns with high-capacity magazines and questioned why his family should not have the same.\nThe march to the end of the spring legislative session took on additional political intrigue amid discussion that House Republican leader Tom Cross of Oswego may soon leave his post.\nCross said he has not made a decision and is focused on a variety of high-profile issues as lawmakers face a May 31 adjournment deadline.\n"I\'m focused on pensions, fracking and the budget," said Cross, whose caucus suffered losses in the November election and fell further into minority status. "So I\'m going to stay on that."\nBut other House Republican lawmakers said Cross has begun looking elsewhere, possibly at a run for attorney general or the private sector.\n"Sometimes we\'re asked from time to time to look at things, and I would say … that it\'s fair to say that the leader is exploring options," said Rep. Dennis Reboletti, R-Elmhurst.\nReboletti and Rep. Mike Bost of Murphysboro each would not rule out a run for Republican leader if Cross were to step down. Both have been mentioned among possible successors, along with veteran Rep. Tim Schmitz of Batavia.\nIn other action, lawmakers sent the governor measures that would:\n•Ban minors from using indoor tanning booths, even with parental consent. The bill, sponsored by Senate Republican leader Christine Radogno of Lemont, passed 34-12.\n•Increase catastrophic injury coverage to student athletes by requiring public and private high schools to supply up to $3 million or five years in benefits, a bill pushed initially by Sen. Napoleon Harris, a former NFL linebacker.\nTribune reporter Ray Long contributed.

Eight weeks after the massacre of 20 Connecticut first-graders, a ban on the kind of semi-automatic rifle used by the killer remains elusive -- if not impossible.\nSuch a ban became a rallying cry for victims\' families, advocacy groups and politicians supporting tougher gun laws in the emotional aftermath of the Newtown shootings in December.\nPresident Barack Obama still calls for updating a 1994 assault weapons ban that expired 10 years later as part of his package of steps intended to reduce chronic gun violence in America, especially in major cities.\nHowever, fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association and millions of American gun owners has shifted debate away from prohibiting specific weapons to making it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns.\nAlong with a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, Obama also wants to limit magazine clips to 10 rounds, expand background checks to all gun sales, crack down on gun trafficking, and strengthen efforts to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.\nThe multi-faceted proposal provided Congress with options on legislation, enhancing chances of passing some provisions, said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, director of social policy and politics at Third Way, a Washington think tank that proposes policy compromises on major issues.\nWhile her group supports a renewed ban on military style weapons, Erickson Hatalsky said "political reality" dictated a different approach.\n"Keeping guns out of the wrong hands is not only more politically palatable but also more effective to stop gun violence," she explained.\nA Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday showed that 92% of respondents support expanding background checks to all gun sales. In households with guns, support was 91%.\nHowever, a majority of households with guns opposed a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, while the full survey showed 56% of respondents backed the provision.\nObama acknowledged on Thursday that Americans have diverse views on the issue, depending on where they grew up and how they live.\n"There are different realities and we have to respect them," he told House Democrats at their policy retreat, noting rural hunters and urban dwellers come from distinct gun cultures.\nAt the same time, the president called for action, saying "there are commonsense steps we can take and build a consensus around, and we cannot shy away from taking them."\nEarlier this week, White House spokesman Jay Carney made clear that the goal was progress on reducing gun violence, rather than any specific provision.\nCarney called proposals backed by legislators from both parties "the first progress we\'ve seen in many, many years dealing with gun violence." But none of the measures he mentioned -- expanded background checks, cracking down on gun trafficking, criminalizing "straw" purchases in which legal buyers obtain weapons for those unable to do so -- included a new ban on semi-automatic weapons.\nNRA President Bob Keene said he expected few substantive changes in law because "people are smarter than politicians," which means "common sense ultimately prevails."\n"They hope that they can use emotion to achieve an anti-firearms agenda that they haven\'t been able to achieve in the past," Keene told a recent Christian Science Monitor breakfast event.\n"I am convinced that as these things are discussed, that we\'re going to come out about where we have come out in the past," he added.\nHis organization keeps a scorecard for each Washington legislator on gun issues, and spends millions on campaign contributions to favored candidates.\nIn the nearly two months since the Newtown shootings, Obama and the White House have sought to maintain public attention on the issue.\nFour days later, Obama will award the Presidential Citizens Medal -- the nation\'s second-highest civiian honor -- posthumously to the six educators killed with the 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nIn Congress, some influential Democrats join virtually all Republicans in opposing, or at least questioning, a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons like the Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used in the Newtown shootings.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who gets high marks from the NRA for his opposition to past gun control efforts, has indicated support for expanding background checks but refuses to endorse a new weapons ban.\nAccording to Reid, a bill from the Senate Judiciary Committee was unlikely to include an updated weapons ban, but he would allow a vote on the provision during floor debate.\nWeapons like the Bushmaster mimic the appearance and some features of fully automatic military rifles, though they technically do not meet the definition of an assault weapon because they are semi-automatic -- meaning each shot requires a trigger pull.\nSupporters of a ban say such weapons have no place in the general public because they are designed solely for rapid-fire killing capacity, rather than hunting or sport shooting.\nThe NRA and other opponents contend that any limit on private gun ownership violates the constitutional right to bear arms. Even partial steps in that direction, such as prohibiting specific models, are considered a path to potential confiscation or other future elimination of Second Amendment rights, they argue.\nIn recent decades, the NRA has led lobbying efforts that shifted the discussion away from stronger gun controls -- such as an outright ban on handguns and a national registration of gun ownership pushed by top Democrats in the 1980s and 90s -- to the incremental measures under consideration now.\nErickson Hatalsky of Third Way noted examples of the NRA\'s influence in the last significant gun legislation -- the Brady Bill of 1993 that required background checks on guns purchased from licensed dealers, followed by the limited assault weapons ban a year later.\nWhile the Brady Bill led to the background check system in use today, the NRA made sure it didn\'t apply to private sales, such as those at gun shows, she said.\nObama and other Democrats now want to close what they call a loophole to make background checks a requirement for any gun sale.\nThe issue gained prominence after the Columbine high school shootings in 1999 in which three guns used by the two underage killers had been purchased by 18-year-old Robyn Anderson at a Colorado gun show to avoid a background check.\nAnderson later told a Colorado House of Representatives committee that the gun purchases had been "too easy."\nThe 1994 weapons ban targeting military style weapons was gone 10 years later, when Congress let it expire in the administration of President George W. Bush -- an outcome sought by the NRA.\nKeene and other NRA officials argue the ban failed to reduce gun violence because it targeted firearms used in only a fraction of the nation\'s gun violence. They also contend the government isn\'t properly enforcing the background checks created by Brady Bill, making an expansion illogical.\n"We are not willing to support measures we feel unduly burden innocent and law-abiding Americans, and on the other side do not have any real impact on the problem we\'re trying to solve," Keene said.\nTo Erickson Hatalsky, the goal is to get laws on the books that make it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns -- either through private sales or from traffickers through straw purchases.\nMinor exceptions would apply to family members giving guns to each other, or people borrowing guns on a hunting ground, she said.\n"How are they going to stop somebody who\'s a gun trafficker if there\'s no federal law against that now," she wondered.\nA tougher issue involves proposed limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, she said. Larger capacity magazines allow semi-automatic weapons to fire dozens of rounds in seconds.\nAt a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun control last week, Mark Kelly argued that the proposed limit could have prevented the death of a young girl in the Tucson, Arizona, attack that seriously wounded his wife -- former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.\nAccording to Kelly, the 13th shot fired killed 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, and the shooter got tackled when trying to reload. With a 10-round limit, Green might still be alive, he said.\nThe NRA and its supporters say larger-capacity magazines are popular, with millions already in the possession of American gun owners who want them to feel secure against criminals armed with similar firepower.\nThey also contend citizens have the right to such weaponry to protect against future government tyranny, which they say was the intent of the Second Amendment\'s right to bear arms.\nErickson Hatalsky rejected any inference by the NRA or its supporters that Obama\'s proposals or other measures being discussed in Congress amount to taking away people\'s guns.\nShe praised the president\'s strategy of presenting a broad package for Congress to consider, saying: "It behooves people who are working on this issue to keep the NRA arguing about lots of different issues, rather than allowing it to concentrate on one and defeat it."

Dalesio in Raleigh, N.C., contributed to this report.</p>', 'text': 'ILION, N.Y. (AP) — The big brick Remington gun factory pieces together military-style rifles in a state that has just banned their sale after a string of mass shootings led to a national outcry over civilian ownership of them.\nResidents of Ilion see the issue far differently: The gun factory is a major local employer and a source of pride for almost two centuries.\nAs Mayor John Stephens put it, "Remington is Ilion. Ilion is Remington."\nLittle wonder that residents in this blue-collar stretch of the Mohawk Valley are defending Remington after state lawmakers banned the sale of semi-automatic rifles like the Bushmaster weapon made there. The move came after the weapon was linked to gunmen in the deadly Connecticut school shooting and in the Christmas Eve slayings of two firefighters in western New York.\nRemington employee Tom Bradle said don\'t blame the guns in mass shootings, blame the shooters.\n"It\'s the person that pulls the trigger. I don\'t care what kind of gun it is," Bradle said as he walked back to the factory from lunch break on a chilly, gray day recently.\nChad Delmedico, who works on Remington\'s Model 700 bolt-action rifle, said it more simply: "We have a bum rap."\nRemington has been intertwined with Ilion since shortly after Eliphalet Remington crafted a flintlock rifle on his father\'s forge in 1816. Even the elementary school shares the company\'s name. Company officials did not respond to calls seeking comment, but locals say the factory employs about 1,200 people and produces Bushmaster, Marlin and H&R products.\nParts of the Remington Arms Co. factory, with its imposing four-story front of brick and old-style, multi-paned windows, date back to the days when upstate New York was a manufacturing powerhouse. But factory jobs have become rarer in the string of modest towns along the Mohawk River, and Ilion, with about 8,000 residents, depends heavily on Remington.\nStephens, the mayor, was disgusted by the news last month of 20 first-graders and six adults killed by a gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. But he is critical of the New York state law approved last week banning certain semi-automatic rifles and large-capacity magazines and calling for background checks on ammunition purchases, among other measures. He dismisses the idea that there\'s an emotional link between Newtown and Ilion.\n"Are people disappointed and distraught?" Stephens asked. "Do they feel bad and are they sad? Absolutely! Absolutely! I would never wish that on anyone, never. But as far as an emotional attachment between us and them, I don\'t see it."\nStephens voiced a sentiment heard frequently in this largely conservative area: New York\'s law and the sweeping gun regulation package proposed recently by President Barack Obama are wrongheaded.\nThe New York law, starting when Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed it Jan. 15, defined as illegal assault weapons semi-automatic rifles that accept detachable magazines and have one additional military-style feature such as a pistol grip, flash suppressor or bayonet mount. The old law required two such features.\nAt the State Bowling Center next to the Remington factory, Rod Brown said the weapon that the Newtown gunman used could easily have been a Smith & Wesson or a Browning instead of a Bushmaster model.\nKelley Holmes-Morton in her salon, Heads-R-Turning, said she is a National Rifle Association member who believes gun makers are not to blame. And Betty Watkins said as she pumped gas that the Second Amendment, about people\'s right to bear arms, is being "pushed around and misused."\nRobbi Breit at the Sellers Avenue consignment shop seemed more conflicted than others in Ilion but still feels that closing Remington won\'t end gun violence.\n"I cried my heart out" after Sandy Hook, she said. "I\'m torn between both sides. But you can get another job. You can\'t get another kid."\nBushmaster is owned by Freedom Group Inc., the largest firearms maker in the U.S., which has its headquarters on Remington Drive outside the neighboring small towns of Madison and Mayodan, N.C.\nNo guns or ammunition are manufactured there. Most people around know the 43,000-square-foot building near the high school and the Walmart as the home of Remington Arms, which moved to the site in the mid-1990s, and not the weapons conglomerate Freedom Group has become, said Mayodan Town Manager Michael Brandt.\n"They\'re not big contributors to the community like a typical large company would be in an area," Brandt said. "This is where they\'re located, but we don\'t really see much of them."\nWord that Freedom Group is for sale and changes are looming has generated little local concern in an area where surviving textile producers and a Miller-Coors brewery are bigger employers, said Sharon Chirichella, who runs a temporary staffing agency and is an officer with the local chamber of commerce.\nThat contrasts with Ilion, where the concern among people is the future of Remington. The company had said last March it could leave New York if the state went ahead with a move to add unique identifying information on spent bullet casings. That proposal is off the table, but people in town wonder where things stand in the wake of the new state law, which does not affect Remington\'s ability to manufacture military-style weapons.\n"If I\'m an executive at Remington, what\'s my attitude going to be toward the state that bans one of the premier products that I produce?" local Assemblyman Marc Butler asked.\nObama\'s gun control proposal added more uncertainty. Jamie Rudwall, who has worked at the plant since 1995 and is president of the United Mine Workers of America Local 717, said he expected the gun business to increase in the short term amid new regulatory proposals, but he worries about jobs in Ilion long term.\n"We\'ve been here almost 200 years," he said. "I hope to be here another 200."\n___\nAP Business Writer Emery P. Dalesio in Raleigh, N.C., contributed to this report.

R&R created their hoax-paper to deny the basic lessons of modern Balance Sheet Recession economics.\n– Follow up from Reinhart and Rogoff has featured more lies about academic critics. R&R insist on putting an Ivy League stamp on dishonest NeoCon tomfoolery. R&R admit to publishing bogus numbers and have yet to resign. (In their world only “the Left” care about dishonesty.)\n– Another recent hoax blames Obama for the Boston massacre. Seems that the elder brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was on at least one “watch list.” Then no one watched him. The RWNJ crew tell the story — omitting that these brothers came to the United States and got their papers under the anti-Putin policies of GW Bush.\nRepublican talking points = one hoax after another.\n– Growth in a Time of Debt\nscholar.harvard.edu/files/rogoff/files/growth_in_time_debt_aer.pdf\n– FBI 2011 Civilian Justifiable Homicide\nwww.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-15\nThe Left ??? If you see a leftie hoax, let us know about it. One story going aorund is that Ronald Reagan lost 241 Marines in Lebanon in 1983. But that turns out to be true. And another 63 dead at the Beirut embassy 6 months earlier.\nYou get a RWNJ objection that NRA is clean, then send them here:\nhttp://mediamatters.org/...\nNRA are as nasty and dishonest as Limbaugh.

so ably put it in his Jan. 30 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, universal background checks necessitate a gun registry if they are to be enforceable.

The U.S. Attorney’s office that led to the six arrests, prosecutions, and sentences as “a long-term investigation.” This indicates that the area’s gun-bans resulted in an extended period of time where the only people carrying firearms were criminals with no regard for law. The case further indicates that even with some of the nation’s strictest guns laws, it took a long-term effort to apprehend and charge gun-toting felons and prevent their guns from being a threat to law-abiding citizens who are left defenseless against such criminals.

What happens to a president who romps to re-election, channels a national tragedy that sparked coast-to-coast outrage into a deeply personal crusade, then fails to get a measure backed by 9 out of 10 Americans through the Senate, where his party holds a majority? Thanks to the NRA-fueled defeat of a bill that might have mildly tightened limits on gun sales, President Barack Obama is learning the hard way.\nFor the families of those killed or wounded by gun violence and who watched with judging eyes as the Senate killed the measure by a vote of 54-46 (it needed a supermajority of 60 votes to pass), what to make of the vote was an easy call.\n“Shame on you!” Patricia Maisch shouted from the visitors gallery above the Senate floor.\nMaisch, a grandmotherly figure who disarmed the shooter in the Tucson carnage that nearly claimed the life of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, was happy to elaborate as reporters swarmed her after the vote. “I decided I could not sit still,” she said. “They have no souls, they have no compassion.”\nBut on Wednesday, they had the votes.\nThat’s Message One for Obama from this stinging legislative defeat: Having emotion and the majority on your side isn’t enough. NRA leader Wayne LaPierre, after all, didn\'t even need to show up.\nThe knock on Obama has often been that he’s Mr. Spock, viewing his approach as the most logical and assuming that logic will trump the other side’s arguments and emotions. But only the most cynical observers will argue that the president didn’t take this fight personally—with frequent flashes of very public anger and anguish ever since the slaughter of 20 schoolchildren at Sandy Hook Elementary. And supporters of the legislation deployed the families of the slain as lobbyists in the weeks leading up to the vote.\nMoreover, as the White House never tired of pointing out, polls show roughly 90 percent of Americans support expanded background checks.\n"I will put everything I\'ve got into this, and so will Joe," Obama promised in January, with Vice President Biden at his side. "But I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it."\nIn the end, though, four red-state Democrats joined 41 of the Senate\'s 45 Republicans to defeat the bill. Why stick their necks out for legislation whose death in the Republican-led House of Representatives was essentially foreordained?\n"It came down to politics—the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections. They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment," Obama said in a passionate assessment in the White House Rose Garden after the vote. "And obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too. And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse—any excuse—to vote \'no.\'"\nThat would seem to bode ill for Obama in the early months of a second term. A re-elected president at perhaps the height of his persuasive powers couldn\'t even get his own party in line behind this widely popular measure.\nObama\'s 2012 campaign juggernaut, overhauled and renamed Organizing for Action—an unprecedented grassroots effort devoted entirely to advancing his agenda—didn\'t tip the balance. There will be hard votes in the future on immigration, on taxes and spending, maybe on energy and climate change. He\'s doomed!\nMessage Two: No, he\'s not.\nRepublican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a staunch conservative and fierce Obama critic, told Yahoo News that Wednesday\'s vote was a fight over the Second Amendment. "I wouldn\'t think it has any broader implication" for Obama\'s agenda, he said.\nSo no spillover effect on immigration? "I don\'t think so," Cornyn said.\nSure, former President George W. Bush\'s second term never really recovered from his failed push to partly privatize Social Security. But that effort was powerfully unpopular, including among Republicans, while the goal of tamping down gun violence is broadly popular.\nWhich brings up Message Three: Obama\'s push on gun safety has suffered a terrible setback, but it\'s far from over.\nSurrounded in the Rose Garden by parents of slain Sandy Hook schoolchildren, Obama never said the words "2014 mid-term elections." He didn\'t need to.\n"We can do more if Congress gets its act together. And if this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters," he declared. "You need to let your representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and that if they don’t act this time, you will remember come election time."\nMaybe, but Message Four is that this White House needs to get better organized.\nDemocrats from states with large gun-owning populations complained privately that the Obama operation never seemed to know how to talk to gun owners. Several told Yahoo News that Obama hasn\'t really moved past his 2008 depiction of small-town Americans who "cling to guns or religion." Gun rights-favoring media, too, complained about the message.\nThere was a weird, telling little moment in the debate that highlighted the White House\'s struggle.\nIn early April, top Obama pollster Joel Benenson wrote a New York Times op-ed describing a poll his firm conducted that found, as he described it, that Americans don\'t really know what the country\'s gun laws actually say. Benenson was trying to beat back the core NRA argument against new gun laws: that authorities must enforce existing gun laws. But his column sent another message: that Team Obama had not really scrutinized the NRA argument until April.\nWatch the entire speech on Yahoo! News:

Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy signed the nation\'s most far-reaching gun control bill Thursday, the ceremony in Hartford concluding several emotional weeks of debate and compromise since the state was rocked and the world stunned by the mass murder of children in Newtown.\n"This is a profoundly emotional day for everyone in this room," Malloy, a Democrat, said moments before signing the bill. He added that he hoped the state\'s bipartisan effort would provide an example for Congress.\n"When 92% of Americans agree that every gun sale should be subject to a background check, there is no excuse" not to make it federal law, Malloy said.\nThe Connecticut law adds more than 100 weapons to the state\'s ban on assault weapons, limits the capacity of ammo magazines and requires background checks for all weapon sales, including at gun shows.\nIt also establishes the nation\'s first statewide registry for people convicted of crimes involving dangerous weapons. Access to the registry would be available only to law enforcement.\nNicole Hockley\'s 6-year-old, Dylan, was among the 20 children who died when Adam Lanza began shooting inside Sandy Hook Elementary on Dec. 14. He also killed six adult staff before killing himself. Hockley said she appreciated the bipartisan political effort that led to the law.\n"While I am grateful for the progress being made, I wish more than anything that I was just back at home waiting for both Dylan and Jake to come home from school," she said.\nHockley said her effort to press the law forward was one way to honor her son\'s life. "We want Newtown to be known not for tragedy, but for transformation," Hockley said.\nThe state House voted early Thursday in favor of the 139-page bill crafted by leaders from both major parties. The bill passed the Senate in a 26-10 vote Wednesday. Both bodies are Democrat-controlled.\nThe bill drew angry protests at the Capitol this week, with some gun rights supporters booing leading advocates of the bill. But in Newtown the bill and the bipartisan effort involved in its passage were warmly received.\nLt. Gov. Nancy Wyman on Thursday thanked the families of all the victims for their leadership in the effort. "I\'ve been amazed at the strength of the families since that day at Newtown," said Wyman, a Democrat. "Today won\'t make up for all that went on that day. But I have gained so much strength from these families, and I thank you."\nNewtown First Selectman Pat Llodra, the town\'s chief executive officer and a Republican, said she is "pleased for the most part" with the legislation.\n"It includes action on some of the most critical elements in gun control and certainly signifies to the rest of the country — and maybe the world — that significant, meaningful change can come about through the political process," Llodra said.\nThe bill was drawn up by a bipartisan task force assembled after the Dec. 14 Newtown massacre.\n"The tragedy in Newtown demands a powerful response, demands a response that transcends politics," said Senate President Donald Williams.\nWhile Republican state Sen. John Kissel of Enfield acknowledged that "you just can\'t have a heart at all if you don\'t feel for the families and friends and neighbors of the victims of that Newtown massacre," he expressed concern that the law is ultimately harmful to lawful gun owners.\n"When it comes to further regulations on guns and ammunition in one of the states that\'s touted as having, right now, some of the most tough gun laws in the United States of America, I think it goes one step too far," said Kissel, who opposed the bill.\nBut Wyman said the intent was not to take away anyone\'s rights. "The intent is simply to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them," she said.\nAmong the law\'s provisions are a requirement of eligibility certificates for the purchase of any rifle, shotgun or ammunition. Penalties for illegal possession and firearms trafficking would also be significantly increased.\nIn addition to the controls on guns and ammunition, the law sets safety standards for school buildings, allow mental health training for teachers and expand mental health research in the state.\nThe law does not ban large-capacity magazines outright, but grandfathers them in from Jan. 1, 2014. The magazines can be loaded only with 10 or fewer rounds, except in the owner\'s home or at a shooting range. Owners must register the magazines by year\'s end.\nThursday would have been the 7th birthday of Ana Marquez-Greene, who died at Sandy Hook. In an op-ed column appearing Thursday in USA TODAY, her parents, Jimmy Greene and Nelba Marquez-Greene, write:\n"We don\'t need new laws to begin strengthening the bonds of family and community. We can be more giving, loving parents, friends and neighbors. We can offer love to those who are outcasts or alone. We can look to God and form an eternal relationship built from nothing but love.\n"But we must do more. Today (Thursday), the governor of our home state of Connecticut will sign historic bipartisan legislation designed by legislators to make our communities safer. Their cooperative spirit should be a model for Congress, when the Senate considers legislation next week to reduce gun violence."\nContributing: Gary Stoller; The Associated Press

The latest Washington Post/ABC poll shows little deviation in American views about new gun legislation from what we've been seeing in other polls since the elementary school slaughter in Newtown, Connecticut, four months ago. Americans, the poll showed, still support changes that would tighten rules on owning firearms. By a small plurality, however, 49 percent to 45 percent, they disapprove of how President Obama is handling the matter.\nThe poll, which also inquired about views on immigration, budget cuts, jobs and the economy, included 13 questions on guns.\nAmong them:\n• Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on the sale of assault weapons? 56 percent supported, 42 percent opposed.\n• Would you support or oppose a law requiring a nationwide ban on high-capacity ammunition clips, meaning those containing more than 10 bullets? 56 percent support, 41 percent oppose.\n• Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online? 86 percent support, 13 percent oppose.\n• Say someone legally sells a gun that later is used in a crime. Do you think the crime victim should or should not be able to sue the gun seller for damages? 24 percent say they should be able to sue, 72 percent say they should not.\n• Do you or does anyone in your house own a gun, or not? 43 percent say yes, 55 percent say no.\nPlease continue reading more gun questions and poll analysis below the fold.\n• Do you think having a gun in the house makes it (a safer place to be) or (a more dangerous place to be)? 51 percent say safer, 29 percent say more dangerous.\n• Have you ever given money to an organization involved in the gun control issue or not? 10 percent say they have, 90 percent say they have not.\n• Thirty percent of those surveyed say they, relatives or close personal friends have been victims of a crime involving a gun.\nAmendments to the basic gun bill introduced in the Senate before the spring recess will be voted on as the debate on that bill unfolds.\nOne with a meager amount of bipartisan support would require background checks for all firearms purchases at gun shows, on the internet or that are advertised in a public medium. A vote on that could happen as early as Wednesday. Despite that 86 percent support from the American public, however, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Vice President Joe Biden and the two senators who drafted the amendment—Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia—are still coming up short in their effort to obtain the 60 votes needed to overcome any potential Republican filibuster.\nAmendments to ban assault weapons and set a limit on the capacity of ammunition magazines will also be offered. Both are DOA, despite the popular support for them.\nThe pollsters did not ask those surveyed their views of a possible Republican-sponsored amendment that would federalize rules on carrying concealed firearms. If passed, this would require states with strict permits in such matters to honor permits from states with lax requirements. It's something that's been high on the wish list of the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights groups for some time.

Connecticut lawmakers reached a bipartisan deal Monday on what they consider some of the toughest gun laws in the country and hope will be a model for other capitals, pushing to expand the state\'s assault-weapons ban and impose new restrictions on high-capacity magazines.\nThe proposal came hours ahead of the release late Tuesday morning of the National Rifle Association\'s report on school safety proposals. The NRA commissioned the study in the wake of the Newtown shooting, as the group pushed for enhanced school security rather than measures to curb gun ownership.\nThe Connecticut deal, by contrast, focuses on gun control measures -- though it left some on both sides of the debate unhappy. Gun control advocates, and particularly families of those killed or injured in the December Newtown shooting, were disappointed the proposal only included a ban on new high-capacity magazines -- and not existing ones.\nAnd gun-rights groups argued that the latest proposal would not have prevented the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n"They can register magazines and do all the rest of this stuff. It isn\'t going to do anything," said Robert Crook, executive director of the Connecticut Coalition of Sportsmen.\nGun owners, who\'ve packed public hearings at the state Capitol in recent months, voicing their opposition to various gun control measures, are concerned they\'ve been showing up "for virtually nothing" after learning about the bill, Crook said.\n"Clearly we\'ve made our point," Crook said. "But I don\'t know what anybody can do at this point in time."\nConnecticut lawmakers announced a deal Monday which would include a ban on new high-capacity ammunition magazines like the ones used in the massacre that left 20 children and six educators dead. The proposal includes new registration requirements for existing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets.\nThe package also creates what lawmakers said is the nation\'s first statewide dangerous weapon offender registry, creates a new "ammunition eligibility certificate," imposes immediate universal background checks for all firearms sales, and extends the state\'s assault weapons ban to 100 new types of firearms and requires that a weapon have only one of several features in order to be banned.\nThe newly banned weapons could no longer be bought or sold in Connecticut, and those legally owned already would have to be registered with the state, just like the high-capacity magazines.\n"No gun owner will lose their gun," said House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero Jr., a Norwalk Republican. "No gun owner will lose their magazines."\nThe bill also addresses mental health and school security measures.\nThe shooting Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School reignited the gun debate in the country and led to calls for increased gun control legislation on the federal and state levels. While some other states, including neighboring New York, have strengthened their gun laws, momentum has stalled in Congress, whose members were urged by President Obama last week not to forget the shooting and to capitalize on the best chance in years to stem gun violence.\nConnecticut should be seen as an example for lawmakers elsewhere, said Senate President Donald E. Williams Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat.\n"In Connecticut, we\'ve broken the mold," he said. "Democrats and Republicans were able to come to an agreement on a strong, comprehensive bill. That is a message that should resound in 49 other states and in Washington, D.C. And the message is: We can get it done here and they should get it done in their respective states and nationally in Congress."\nThe proposal was revealed to rank-and-file lawmakers Monday after weeks of bipartisan, closed-door negotiations among legislative leaders. A vote was expected Wednesday in the General Assembly, where Democrats control both chambers, making passage all but assured. The bill would then be sent to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who has helped lead efforts to strengthen the state\'s gun laws but has not yet signed off on the proposed legislation.\nEarlier in the day on Monday, Malloy voiced support for the Newtown families and their desire to ban the possession of large-capacity magazines.\nRon Pinciaro, executive director of Connecticut Against Gun Violence, said his group will live with the lawmakers\' decision not to ban them as other states have done. He said the leaders made their decision based on what was politically feasible.\n"We have to be satisfied. There are still other things that we want, we\'ll be back for in later sessions," he said. "But for now, it\'s a good thing."\nSix relatives of Newtown victims visited the Capitol on Monday, asking lawmakers to ban existing high-capacity magazines. Some handed out cards with photographs of their slain children.\nAllowing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets to remain in the hands of gun owners would leave a gaping loophole in the law, said Mark Barden, whose 7-year-old son, Daniel, was killed in the shooting.\n"It doesn\'t prevent someone from going out of the state to purchase them and then bring them back. There\'s no way to track when they were purchased, so they can say, `I had this before,"\' Barden said. "So it\'s a big loophole."\nJake McGuigan, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is based in Newtown, said he wouldn\'t comment on the proposal until he saw it in the writing, but he questioned the mechanics of a registry for magazines.\n"How will they register a magazine? It seems a little weird," he said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Julio Cortez, AP\nSandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\nMILFORD, Conn. — Families of 20 children and six adults killed in the mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school each will receive $281,000 from the $11.4 million in donations, an oversight board said on Wednesday.\nThe Newtown Sandy Hook Foundation, which oversees the donations, also decided that the families of 12 children who witnessed and survived the attack at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December each will get $20,000 and two teachers who were injured will split $150,000.\nOf the total $11.4 million in donations raised with the help of the United Way charity, $7.7 million was set aside for the victims of what was one of the worst mass school shootings in U.S. history. The remaining $3.7 million was dedicated to a long-term community fund, a decision by the foundation board that has been criticized by some victims\' families and Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy.\n"You really have to ask the foundation board why it decided not to distribute all the donated funds to the families," said Kenneth Feinberg, who advised the distribution committee and also oversaw compensation for victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks, the theater shootings in Aurora, Colo., and the Boston Marathon bombing.\nDr. Charles Herrick, chairman of the foundation board, pointed out "the board decided to distribute 95 percent of the funds directly to the families, but there are many, many victims — including 400 students at the school that day and all the first responders.\n"We wanted to ensure there are some funds left for the future needs of people in the community who are going to need help," said Herrick, a Newtown resident and chairman of the Department of Psychiatry of the Western Connecticut Health Network, which oversees Danbury and New Milford Hospitals.\n"This is a balancing act and there are other victims we have to think about too," he said. "This is a marathon, not a sprint and there\'s no way to know what problems will arise over the next 10 years."\nIn a letter to the board, Malloy insisted that an independent third party from outside of Newtown be chosen to oversee any remaining funds. Herrick said the board would press ahead with its plan to appoint another local distribution committee by mid-September to oversee the money.\nPopular Discussio

The ad is first to feature families of victims slain at Sandy Hook school in December\nMayors Against Illegal Guns%2C led by Michael Bloomberg and Thomas Menino%2C produced the ad\nPresident Obama meets Thursday with survivors of gun violence and law enforcement officials\nFamilies of four victims killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School are featured in a gripping new TV ad aimed at spurring action by Congress to reduce gun violence.\n"Don\'t let the memory of Newtown fade without doing something real," pleads Terri Rousseau, whose daughter, Lauren, was a teacher at the Connecticut school where 20 children and six adults were killed on Dec. 14.\nThe ad is the first to feature Newtown families and coincides with President Obama\'s meeting Thursday at the White House with survivors of gun violence and law enforcement officials. There are also more than 120 events planned across the country in a National Day to Demand Action on reducing gun violence, led by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which sponsors the new commercials.\nThe Senate is expected to take up gun legislation in April, but the measure will not include a proposed ban on assault weapons and a limit on the ammunition contained in magazine clips. The legislation will incorporate bills to enhance background checks for gun owners, reduce gun trafficking and improve school safety.\nIn the spot, Neil Heslin speaks in the ad of dropping off his son, Jesse Lewis, at Sandy Hook and then receiving a 911 call about the shooting. An emotional Heslin told his story at a Senate hearing in February on the gun ban.\n"I want to prevent any other family from having to go through what we\'re going through," said Chris McDonnell, father of 7-year-old Grace, who died in the rampage.\nThe ad also features Jillian Soto, sister of Vicki, who was a teacher at Sandy Hook. The commercial is running in the Hartford TV market because the Connecticut Legislature is considering gun-control bills.\nMayors Against Illegal Guns is co-chaired by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. Bloomberg in particular has been a vocal gun-control advocate, using both the mayors\' group and his own super PAC to push for new legislation.

Republican lawmakers in Colorado say they want the White House to stay out of their state battle over gun control, accusing Vice President Biden of personally leaning on Democratic legislators for their votes in a tight campaign that could change the national conversation on gun rights.\nRepublican state Rep. Carole Murray told FoxNews.com she doesn’t appreciate “East Coast politics” interfering in her state.\nThe concern comes ahead of a tense Senate vote -- which could come late next week -- and after a vote in the House that prompted the White House to take the unusual step of lobbying wavering Democrats. Biden’s office confirmed to FoxNews.com he made four phone calls to Colorado Democrats, two in moderate districts, but did not say what they were about.\nMultiple sources, though, tell FoxNews.com that about eight hours into last week’s 12-hour House debate, Biden called Democrats Mark Ferrandino, Mike McLachlan, Tony Exum and Dominick Moreno to solidify support for the measures and to “remind them about the importance of the legislation.”\nHouse lawmakers in Colorado, home to two of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history, narrowly passed a handful of gun control bills last week. The measures are headed to the Senate in early March where they are expected to face an uphill battle, though it\'s unclear what steps the White House might take this time to solidify support.\nExplaining the substance of the Biden call last week, Exum told The Denver Post the vice president "said it would send a strong message to the rest of the country that a western state had passed gun-control bills."\nOne measure would limit magazines to 15 rounds for firearms and eight for shotguns. Every House Republican, as well as three Democrats, voted against that measure, which passed 34-31. The House also approved a bill requiring background checks on all gun purchases, including those between private sellers and firearms bought online.\nThe third proposal would ban concealed firearms at colleges and stadiums, while the fourth would require gun purchasers to pay for their own background checks. The closest vote was on the background check measure, which passed on a 33-32 vote.\nRepublicans argue that the proposals restrict their Second Amendment rights and have called the bills a “knee-jerk reaction” to the recent mass shootings in Colorado and Connecticut.\nThough Democrats have a majority in both Colorado chambers, they will have a tougher time passing the legislation in the Senate, where they have only a 20-15 majority. That means Republicans and other gun rights supporters need to turn only three Democrats to defeat the bills.\nColorado has taken center stage in the country’s fight over gun control. As the White House struggles to pass gun control legislation on Capitol Hill, where a Republican majority in the House ensures that only a bipartisan bill can make it through, a successful push for such legislation in the purple, pro-gun rights state of Colorado would be seen as a major victory.\nLawyer Jan Baran, though, said lobbying state legislators from Washington would only venture into illegal territory if Biden made a promise of money for a vote.\n“Unless it’s some very specific promise that involves money, it’s just good ol’ politics,” Baran said.\nColorado has attracted national interest from the National Rifle Association as well. David Keene, president of the NRA, went to Denver last month to meet with Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and Senate President John Morse.\nKeene called universal background checks a political “sweet spot” and added that the current background check systems are underfunded and that forcing them on private sales would be logistically difficult.\nHickenlooper has said in the past he supports background checks but has flip-flopped on almost every other gun control issue – something Republicans point to as proof he’s being politically pressured.\nWhile unusual, this is not the first time the White House has meddled in state battles.\nIn May 2002, negotiations over two New York congressional districts intensified after a panel of federal judges approved a plan to eliminate them, but said it was still “willing, indeed eager” to let state lawmakers create a fair plan of their own. Vice President Dick Cheney called the Republican leader of the state Senate to discuss concerns about the lines the court had drawn.\nIn February 2000, President Clinton used a meeting of the National Governors Association to recruit governors to lobby for a bill that would normalize trading relations with China, as part of a broad effort to build support for China’s administration to the World Trade Organization.\nIn June 1994, then-first lady Hillary Clinton pitched her husband’s universal health care plan to a group of Oklahoma state lawmakers, a labor leader and hospital administrators. One person who attended the event told The Saturday Oklahoman that “the implication” was there that they should ask the delegation to support the Clinton plan.

USATODAY\nPresident Obama will promote his plan to battle gun violence on Monday in Minneapolis because that community is doing some of the things he wants to see nationally.\nMinneapolis has launched a youth violence initiative that has seen some success; and sheriffs in Minnesota have worked to improve the state\'s background check system for gun buyers.\nDuring his visit Monday, Obama will "discuss with local leaders and law enforcement officials his comprehensive set of common sense ideas to reduce gun violence," the White House says.\nThe president has called for universal background checks, renewal of an assault weapons ban, and restrictions on the size of ammunition magazines, as well as new school safety and mental health programs.\nThe gun-control push comes in the wake of a series of mass shootings, including the Dec. 14 attack on an elementary school in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six adults.\nObama has vowed to promote his plan in appearances across the country.\nMinneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau and Hennepin County Sheriff Richard Stanek were among the local law enforcement officials who met at the White House this week with Obama and Vice President Biden, who helped develop the White House plan.\n"Minneapolis is a city that has taken important steps to reduce gun violence and foster a conversation in the community about what further action is needed," said a White House statement. "President Obama will visit with members of the community about their experiences and discuss additional steps that can be taken at the federal level to reduce gun violence."

Florida Gov. Rick Scott met with protesters overnight and defended his position to not amend his state\'s controversial "stand your ground" law.\n"Tonight, the protesters again asked that I call a special session of the legislature to repeal Florida\'s \'stand your ground\' law," Scott said in a written statement. "I told them I agree with the Task Force on Citizen Safety and Protection, which concurred with the law."\nScott issued a proclamation Friday for a "statewide day of prayer for unity." The proclamation calls Trayvon Martin\'s death a tragedy, notes that "emotions are running high" and calls for Floridians to show unity.\nEarlier, Scott said that he mourns with Martin\'s parents, but that he stands by the findings of the task force, which consulted with citizens and experts.\nThe protesters are students and members of Dream Defenders, an activist group that participates in civic engagement and promotes nonviolent social change.\nThey walked into Scott\'s office Wednesday, led by Amon Gabriel, 9, and asked to speak to the governor.\nAfter the protesters camped there for three days, Scott met with them overnight and told them he has not changed his position. The Dream Defenders say they will continue their sit-in until their demand is met.\n"We\'d like the repeal of \'stand your ground\' or some type of modification where we can hold people responsible to a level that humanity expects, where we don\'t have 17-year-olds getting gunned down with no justice for them and their families," said the group\'s legal and policy director, Ahmad Abuznaid.\nOn Thursday, Florida officials joined state House Democratic Leader Perry Thurston in urging that reforms be made to the controversial law.\nOne of those officials, Senate Democratic Leader Chris Smith, is refiling his legislation to change "stand your ground."\n"We have a clear case that shows SYG has very troubling problems, and those problems are central to the well-being of Floridians," he said.\nThough former neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman\'s defense never cited "stand your ground" laws in its case, the jury was instructed to consider them during deliberations. The jury acquitted Zimmerman of all charges Saturday in the 2012 shooting death of Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old.\nThe Florida version of the law states, "A person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any other place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony."\nEight other states have laws worded similarly, while 22 total states, including Florida, have laws stating that residents have no "duty" to retreat from a would-be attacker, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\nCivil rights groups attack the laws as racially motivated and are planning nationwide demonstrations. Stevie Wonder is refusing to perform in any state with such a law.\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the laws "try to fix something that was never broken" and now encourage "violent situations to escalate in public."\nBut just as adamantly as the laws are decried, the National Rifle Association has stood by the measures it helped many states adopt.\n"The attorney general fails to understand that self-defense is not a concept; it\'s a fundamental human right," said Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA\'s Institute for Legislative Action. "To send a message that legitimate self-defense is to blame is unconscionable."\nAs for those Dream Defenders at the Florida governor\'s office, their protest may be futile. Scott\'s office noted that the gubernatorial task force recommends the law stay in place, though with minor tweaks, including limiting neighborhood watches to observing and reporting.\nDaniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said he doubts the protests will change anything. Overturning laws isn\'t incredibly common already, and with "stand your ground," there are complicating factors.\nThe NRA is strong in the 22 states that have the laws, and "I think there is some popular appeal to the notion, the very general notion, that citizens should be able to protect themselves and you shouldn\'t have to, in essence, run from crime."\nAlso, the laws are relatively new, most of them enacted in the past eight years, and it\'s unlikely the same legislators who put "stand your ground" laws on the books would suddenly be inclined to think they were wrong.\nAs a parallel, Webster offered the "Draconian" drug sentencing laws of the 1980s, which hugely expanded incarceration rates, were outrageously expensive and did little to improve public safety. Yet, the country is only now examining those laws and considering their repeal.\n"I assume, in part, that\'s because the people who passed them are no longer there," Webster said.\nThe trickiest factor, however, is that proponents and opponents of "stand your ground" can find in the Zimmerman case assertions to support their beliefs, he said.\nOne side believes Martin attacked Zimmerman, and Zimmerman had no choice but to fire his weapon to defend himself. The other side believes Zimmerman racially profiled Martin, followed him against a dispatcher\'s order and then shot a teen who was only reacting, perhaps out of fear, to being followed.\nPutting on his gun policy expert hat, Webster said he felt the laws are a "very bad idea," and they don\'t do what they were intended to do: deter criminals and protect the citizenry.\nAfter Florida expanded its "Castle Doctrine" laws to a "stand your ground" provision in 2005, the National District Attorneys Association released a report. It said a "diminished sense of public safety" after 9/11, a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system\'s ability to protect victims, a perception that due process trumps victims\' rights and a decrease in gun legislation spurred the creation of "stand your ground" laws.\n"There must be appreciation among the would-be criminals that deadly force can be used against them, leading to a change in criminal behavior," the study said. "Unfortunately, attendees at the National District Attorneys Association symposium expressed little confidence that criminals would take the provisions of the Castle Doctrine into consideration before committing a crime."\nWebster pointed to a Texas A&M University study examining crime in more than 20 states that passed Castle Doctrine or "stand your ground" laws from 2000 to 2010. Researchers found that not only was there no decrease in robbery, burglary and aggravated assault, but there was an 8% spike in reported murders and non-negligent manslaughter.\n"The data are pretty compelling, showing that it increased justifiable homicides, and it increased homicides overall," Webster said. "In all likelihood, it really led to more altercations similar to the Zimmerman-Martin exchange."\nA national "Justice for Trayvon" day is slated for Saturday in 100 cities, led by the Rev. Al Sharpton. The protesters will call for federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman.

Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband former astronaut Mark Kelly had lunch today with former President George H.W. Bush and his wife Barbara at their Kennebunkport, Maine home, Giffords spokeswoman Pia Carusone tells ABC News.\nGiffords and Kelly are on their seven-day seven-state "Rights and Responsibilities Tour," to push for expanded background checks for firearms purchases. They are also being accompanied by some families of victims of the Sandy Hook school shooting who were with them Friday evening in New Hampshire and today in Maine.\nThis isn\'t the first time Giffords and Bush have met. When Giffords was recovering in a Houston hospital, Bush and his wife Barbara went to visit her. In her 2011 memoir with Kelly, they write that at that point in her recovery she could only say "chicken" to the former president and first lady.\nBush has an interesting history with gun control himself. In 1989, then President George H. W. Bush issued an executive order halting the importation of some semi-automatic firearms after a mass shooting that killed five children and wounded 29 others in California in January 1989. The shooter used an AK-47 assault rifle.\nIn 1995, the former president resigned from the National Rifle Association after the NRA compared agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to "Nazis" who harass gun owners.\n"Your broadside against federal agents deeply offends my own sense of decency and honor, and it offends my concept of service to country," Bush wrote in a letter to the NRA president Thomas Washington on May 3, 1995. "It indirectly slurs a wide array of government law-enforcement officials, who are out there, day and night, laying their lives on the line for all of us."\nIn a fundraising letter at the time NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre, who still holds that title, described federal agents as "wearing Nazi bucket helmets and black storm trooper uniforms" and wanting to "attack law-abiding citizens," which Bush called "vicious slander on good people."

The media coverage of Giffords’ testimony exploited Giffords’ victimhood to the hilt. But led the way with a picture of her “,” which labeled “pen-scrawled words … deliberate … diligent … written on a surface all too familiar to schoolchildren: binder paper.” And, added, “She is trapped in her injury. And few things make that point more powerfully than a piece of binder paper and a hand-scrawled message.”

Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, testified before a Senate hearing Tuesday that so-called "stand your ground" laws demand clarity.\nTwo Florida mothers whose unarmed sons were shot to death gave emotional testimony Tuesday at a Senate panel, demanding that states alter their "stand your ground" laws.\nSybrina Fulton described how the family had just celebrated her son Trayvon Martin\'s 17th birthday three weeks before he was killed in the Retreat at Twin Lakes, a gated community in Sanford, Fla.\n"He was simply going to get a drink and some candy. That tells me right there, his mentality. That tells me that he was not going to get cigarettes or bullets or condoms or other items of that nature," she told a packed Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. "Trayvon was minding his own business."\n"So I just wanted to come here to talk to you for a moment to let you know how important it is that we amend this stand-your-ground because it did not work in my case. The person that shot and killed my son is walking the streets today, and this law does not work. We need to seriously take a look at this law," she said.\nStand-your-ground laws are on the books in at least 22 states and change the legal definition of self-defense for citizens who feel they are being confronted with deadly force or imminent danger, canceling their duty to retreat. But Fulton argued at the hearing that the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting of her son and the acquittal of George Zimmerman over the summer shows that the laws are confusing.\nAlso testifying was Lucia Holman McBath, who wore a pin with a photo of her only child, Jordan Russell Davis, affixed to her chest.\nLucy McBath says the man that shot and killed her son was empowered by the Stand Your Ground statue adding, "I am here to tell you that there was no ground to stand, there was no threat."\nDavis, 17, was killed nearly a year ago when Michael David Dunn, 46, allegedly fired nine rounds on a Dodge Durango with four teenagers inside in Jacksonville, Fla., after complaining about their loud music and claiming he saw a gun. Authorities never found a gun inside.\nMcBath, struggling to hold back tears at one point, told the committee that Dunn sprayed the vehicle with bullets, then went back to his hotel and ordered a pizza. She said he wasn\'t arrested until the following morning.\n"That man was empowered by the \'stand your ground\' statute," McBath said. "I am here to tell you there was no ground to stand. There was no threat. No one was trying to invade his home, his vehicle, nor threatened him or his family."\nDunn\'s trial has been delayed until next year, but McBath said she faces the "very real possibility that my son\'s killer will walk free, hiding behind a statute that lets people claim a threat where there was none."\n"Even the Wild West had more stringent laws governing the taking of life than we have now. Stand-your-ground defies all reason. It goes against the sound system of justice established long ago on this very hill," she said.\nMcBath described her son to the committee: "I can tell you all about him. His easy smile, his first girlfriend, and his plans to join the Marines."\n"But you can never really know my boy because an angry man who owned a gun kept it close at hand and chose to demonstrate unbridled hatred one balmy evening for reasons I will never understand," she said.\nFlorida had the first stand-your-ground law, passed in 2005.\n"Trayvon and Jordan didn\'t ask to be martyrs. The American legal system made them martyrs," Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, said at the hearing. "Stand-your-ground laws eliminate all responsibility to retreat and peacefully end an incident."\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., led the inquiry, calling two panels of witnesses to the hearing room on Tuesday to discuss the issue. The Senate is holding the hearing even though no congressional action is expected on the state policies, according to the AP.\nIn opening the hearing on Tuesday, Durbin said, "It is clearly time for stand-your-ground to be carefully reviewed."\n"These stand-your-ground laws have led to increases in homicides and firearms injuries," he said. "These stand-your-ground laws have allowed shooters to walk free in shocking situations."\nOn the other side of the discussion was Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who questioned what role federal government had in interfering with a state issue.\n"Self-defense is a bedrock liberty of every American, and I would note this is not a new concept," he said, citing the Second Amendment.\nStand your ground laws are sometimes referred to as "Shoot First" laws by detractors. They were part of the public discussion around the Zimmerman trial; although the legal team arguing on behalf of Zimmerman did not ask for an immunity hearing under the law, the instructions given to the jury borrowed language from the statute.\nNormally, a citizen has a duty to retreat when confronted with what they perceive to be deadly force. The stand your ground doctrine mostly removes that, meaning citizens who feel threatened are no longer required to try to quell a situation first before having the right to use deadly force in self-defense.\nGun rights groups, like the National Rifle Association, argue stand your ground laws are about protecting the right to self-defense.\nAlso testifying at the hearing was Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, a strong supporter of stand your ground laws.\nGohmert pointed out to Durbin and others in the hearing that murder rates are higher in Chicago and Washington, D.C., than they are in states that have stand-your-ground laws.\n"[The] idea of being able to stand one\'s ground without first retreating has been combined as part of the law of self-defense in at least 22 states. It might also be noted that these 22 are not necessarily states in which runaway murder rates abound," he said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nRelated content:\nThis story was originally published on Tue Oct 29, 2013 9:26 AM EDT\nPopular Discussio

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama launched the biggest U.S. gun-control push in generations on Wednesday, urging Congress to approve an assault weapons ban and background checks for all gun buyers to prevent mass shootings like the Newtown school massacre.\nRolling out a wide-ranging plan for executive and legislative action to curb gun violence, Obama set up a fierce clash with the powerful U.S. gun lobby and its supporters in Congress, who will resist what they see as an encroachment on constitutionally protected gun rights.\nObama presented his agenda at a White House event in front of an audience that included relatives of some of the 20 first graders who were killed along with six adults by a gunman on December 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.\n“We can’t put this off any longer,” Obama said, vowing to use “whatever weight this office holds” to make his proposals reality. “Congress must act soon,” he said, flanked by schoolchildren.\nIn a sign of how bitter the fight over gun control could get, the National Rifle Association released an advertisement hours before Obama spoke that accused him of hypocrisy for accepting armed Secret Service protection for his daughters. The White House condemned the ad as “repugnant.\nUntil now, Obama had done little to change America’s gun culture. But just days before his second inauguration, he appears determined to champion gun control in his next term, which also will be dominated by debt and spending fights with Congress and a likely debate over immigration reform.\nHis plan calls on Congress to renew a prohibition on assault weapons sales that expired in 2004, require criminal background checks on all gun purchases, including closing a loophole for gun show sales, and pass a new federal gun trafficking law - long sought by big-city mayors to keep out-of-state guns off their streets.\nHe also announced 23 steps he intends to take immediately without congressional approval. These include improving the existing system for background checks, lifting the ban on federal research on gun violence, putting more counselors and “resource officers” in schools and better access to mental health services.\nASSAULT WEAPONS BATTLE\nObama, who has called the day of the Newtown massacre the worst of his presidency, looked down into the audience and addressed the parents of one of the Sandy Hook victims, Grace McDonald, 7, saying he had hung one of her paintings in his private study.\n“Every time I look at that painting, I think about Grace, and I think about the life that she lived and the life that lay ahead of her, and most of all I think about how when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us, we must act now,” he said.\nAs he announced the gun measures, Obama was accompanied by four children chosen from among those who sent letters to him about gun violence and school safety. “We should learn from what happened at Sandy Hook. I feel really bad,” 8-year-old Grant Fritz wrote, in a portion Obama read from the podium.\nThe most contentious piece of the package is Obama’s call for a renewed ban on military-style assault weapons, a move that is unlikely to win approval because Republicans who control the House of Representatives are expected to oppose it.\nU.S. President Barack Obama, flanked by 8-year old letter writer Hinna Zeejah (L), 10-year old letter writer Taejah Goode (3rd L), 11-year old letter writer Julia Stokes and 8-year old letter writer Grant Fritz (R, signs executive orders on gun violence during an event at the White House in Washington, January 16, 2013. REUTERS/Jason Reed\nThe Newtown gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, used a Bushmaster AR-15 type assault rifle to shoot his victims, most of them 6- and 7-year-olds, before killing himself.\nLaw enforcement experts have noted, however, that the tighter background checks that Obama is proposing would not have prevented the Connecticut school massacre because the gunman’s weapon was purchased legally by his mother.\nNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a staunch gun control advocate, said tighter controls were needed no matter what.\n“No piece of legislation is perfect and no piece of legislation is 100 percent effective. Think of it like a speeding limit.

Gun stocks rose Wednesday, even as President Obama called on Congress to pass an assault weapon ban.\nThe stock prices for Smith & Wesson Holding Co. (SWHC) and Sturm, Ruger & Co. (RGR) rose about 4%. The stock for Sturm, Ruger has risen 13% in the month since the shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school that left 20 children and six educators dead.\nRetailers that specialize in guns have also done well. The stock price for Cabela\'s (CAB) surged 6% on Wednesday and has gained 20% over the last month. Dick\'s Sporting Goods (DKS) notched up slightly, and has gained 6% over the month.\nObama issued the call for the assault ban as part of a broad response to the Newtown shooting.\n"Congress should restore the ban on military style assault weapons and a 10-round limit for magazines," the president said. Obama was referring to a 10-year ban that expired in 2004, which limited the capacity of magazines and restricted military-style features on semiautomatic rifles.\nBut the specter of a potential ban in the wake of mass shootings around the country has prompted gun enthusiasts to stock up on the weapons that may some day be denied to them.\n"Consumers are flocking to stores to purchase certain types of firearms, including assault rifles, in fears of some type of ban going forward," said Rommel Dionisio, gun industry analyst for Wedbush Securities. "It\'s people rushing to buy them before they\'re banned."\nDick\'s said last month that it has suspended sales of assault rifles.\nSmith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger manufacture a wide variety of firearms, including the semiautomatic rifles that are known various as assault weapons or modern sporting rifles.\nThere are many other non-public companies that manufacture semiautomatic rifles, including Bushmaster Firearms International, which makes the rifle used at the Newtown shooting and also a recent shooting in Webster, N.Y., where a convict burned down houses and then ambushed and killed two volunteer firefighters.\nSuch a ban, if it passes, would also impact manufacturers of high-capacity magazines. They include the Beta Company, which makes 100-round drums, and SGM Tactical, which produces 30-round and 100-round magazines.\nHigh-capacity magazines face a potential ban because they were used by Adam Lanza in the Newtown shooting and by James Holmes, suspect in a mass shooting last year at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.\nObama acknowledged that he faces serious opposition in trying to get an assault weapon bill passed by a Republican-controlled House.\nEven as Obama spoke, thousands of gun industry members packed into the SHOT Show -- an annual trade show -- in Las Vegas. The show is owned and sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an organization based in Newtown, less than two miles from the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama launched the biggest U.S. gun-control push in generations on Wednesday, urging Congress to approve an assault weapons ban and background checks for all gun buyers to prevent mass shootings like the Newtown school massacre.\nRolling out a wide-ranging plan for executive and legislative action to curb gun violence, Obama set up a fierce clash with the powerful U.S. gun lobby and its supporters in Congress, who will resist what they see as an encroachment on constitutionally protected gun rights.\nObama presented his agenda at a White House event in front of an audience that included relatives of some of the 20 first graders who were killed along with six adults by a gunman on December 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.\n“We can’t put this off any longer,” Obama said, vowing to use “whatever weight this office holds” to make his proposals reality. “Congress must act soon,” he said, flanked by schoolchildren.\nIn a sign of how bitter the fight over gun control could get, the National Rifle Association released an advertisement hours before Obama spoke that accused him of hypocrisy for accepting armed Secret Service protection for his daughters. The White House condemned the ad as “repugnant.\nUntil now, Obama had done little to change America’s gun culture. But just days before his second inauguration, he appears determined to champion gun control in his next term, which also will be dominated by debt and spending fights with Congress and a likely debate over immigration reform.\nHis plan calls on Congress to renew a prohibition on assault weapons sales that expired in 2004, require criminal background checks on all gun purchases, including closing a loophole for gun show sales, and pass a new federal gun trafficking law - long sought by big-city mayors to keep out-of-state guns off their streets.\nHe also announced 23 steps he intends to take immediately without congressional approval. These include improving the existing system for background checks, lifting the ban on federal research on gun violence, putting more counselors and “resource officers” in schools and better access to mental health services.\nASSAULT WEAPONS BATTLE\nObama, who has called the day of the Newtown massacre the worst of his presidency, looked down into the audience and addressed the parents of one of the Sandy Hook victims, Grace McDonald, 7, saying he had hung one of her paintings in his private study.\n“Every time I look at that painting, I think about Grace, and I think about the life that she lived and the life that lay ahead of her, and most of all I think about how when it comes to protecting the most vulnerable among us, we must act now,” he said.\nAs he announced the gun measures, Obama was accompanied by four children chosen from among those who sent letters to him about gun violence and school safety. “We should learn from what happened at Sandy Hook. I feel really bad,” 8-year-old Grant Fritz wrote, in a portion Obama read from the podium.\nThe most contentious piece of the package is Obama’s call for a renewed ban on military-style assault weapons, a move that is unlikely to win approval because Republicans who control the House of Representatives are expected to oppose it.\nU.S. President Barack Obama, flanked by 8-year old letter writer Hinna Zeejah (L), 10-year old letter writer Taejah Goode (3rd L), 11-year old letter writer Julia Stokes and 8-year old letter writer Grant Fritz (R, signs executive orders on gun violence during an event at the White House in Washington, January 16, 2013. REUTERS/Jason Reed\nThe Newtown gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, used a Bushmaster AR-15 type assault rifle to shoot his victims, most of them 6- and 7-year-olds, before killing himself.\nLaw enforcement experts have noted, however, that the tighter background checks that Obama is proposing would not have prevented the Connecticut school massacre because the gunman’s weapon was purchased legally by his mother.\nNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a staunch gun control advocate, said tighter controls were needed no matter what.\n“No piece of legislation is perfect and no piece of legislation is 100 percent effective. Think of it like a speeding limit. You may every once in a while violate the speeding limit, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have speeding limits - they protect people’s lives,” he told reporters.\nAt the firearm industry’s largest trade show in Las Vegas, Gary Svecko - adding a Glock 17 pistol to his gun collection - dismissed Obama’s bid to ban assault weapons purchases and blamed video games for inciting violence.\n“You know the old saying, ‘Guns don’t kill people.

USA TODAY\nThe White House says President Obama is close to completing a series of executive actions to address gun violence, but they are not a substitute for congressional legislation.\nIn a report issued Tuesday, the administration has "completed or made significant progress" on 21 of 23 executive actions that Obama outlined Jan. 16 as part of a major gun-control initiative.\n"But Congress must also act," the report says. "Passing common-sense gun safety legislation, including expanding background checks and making gun trafficking a federal crime, remains the single most important step we could take to reduce gun violence."\nWith Obama in Northern Ireland for the G-8 summit, Vice President Biden will discuss the report in a speech Tuesday afternoon.\nThe Senate blocked a background check bill in April, thanks mostly to the votes of Republicans. Obama administration officials and Senate Democrats are trying to revive the bill by pressuringsenators who voted against it to reconsider.\nGun-control opponents say the proposals are ineffective, and undermine the Second Amendment rights to gun ownership.\nThe Obama administration began pushing for new gun legislation after the Dec. 14 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., that killed 20 students and six educators.\nThe new White House report listed the executive actions on guns taken by the administration.\nAmong them:Ending a freeze on federal research into the causes of gun violence, reducing barriers that prevent states from submitting certain records to the existing background check system, and easing the ways in which federal law enforcement agencies can trace guns recovered in investigations.\nThe report did not mention two other legislative proposals backed by gun-control supporters: A new ban on assault weapons, and restrictions on the size of ammunition magazines. Neither proposal has sufficient support in Congress as of yet.\nThe White House report says the president\'s executive actions are designed to address several goals, including improvements to the existing background check system, law enforcement, and school safety, as well as promote responsible gun ownership.

Last year, Chicago police confiscated 7,400 guns that were used in crimes or were illegally owned, but more firearms quickly arrived on the streets to replace them. Police Supt. Garry McCarthy has likened trying to stop the torrent to drinking out of a firehose. <p>The NRA opposes universal background checks. It helped push through a measure that prohibits the FBI from hanging on for longer than 24 hours to records of those who pass the existing background check system. That makes it hard to spot a pattern of straw purchases. Lawmakers should not be swayed by the NRA on this issue.</p> <p>Waiting for the U.S. Senate to act, though, is not enough. We need to act on the state level, too.</p> </blockquote>\n<p>Head below the fold for more analysis from papers across the country.</p>\n<p>Cook County in Illinois is adding a <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/19211076-761/gun-control-advocates-stand-firm-on-new-cook-county-firearm-tax.html">$25 tax</a> to all firearm purchases and is standing firm in the face of lawsuits:</p>\n<blockquote>The anticipated $600,000 in revenue from the new tax will help the county&rsquo;s health and hospital system, Preckwinkle said. About 30 percent of trauma patients last year at Stroger Hospital were gunshot victims, she said, and each cost taxpayers about $52,000 to treat. <p>Last month, a group of Chicago area firearms dealers and owners sued over the tax, claiming it violates their constitutional rights. Preckwinkle said that group failed to secure an injunction from a judge to temporarily stop the tax, and she said &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t calculate whether or not people are going to sue us when we look at reasonable gun policies.&rdquo;</p> </blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/04/nra-national-school-shield-program/63769/">Adam Clark Estes</a> at <em>The Atlantic</em> looks at the NRA\'s next push:</p>\n<blockquote>While it\'s no secret that the organization has perfected the art of lobbying over the years, they appear to have performed an opus of sorts on Capitol Hill in the past few weeks. Not only has the Senate bill been heavily diluted, but the NRA now has lawmakers parroting its points. Evidence actually suggests that the NRA might help kill the expanded background checks portion of the bill, despite the fact that it was one of the less controversial parts just a couple of months before. &quot;We are in better shape now than our critics and even some within our ranks believed possible when this battle started,&quot; NRA president David Keene told The Huffington Post\'s Howard Fineman as this chapter was coming to a close late last month. All the while, folks like Hutchinson, who is also running for Governor in Arkansas, kept returning to this idea that the Obama administration and friends have a &quot;hidden agenda&quot; to take away everybody\'s guns.</blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/04/nra-still-undermining-weakened-gun-legislation.html">Margaret Hartmann</a> at New York Magazine looks at the NRA\'s unrelenting assault on reasonable gun control measures:</p>\n<blockquote>A week after President Obama suggested that we as a nation should be ashamed of ourselves for forgetting about the Newtown tragedy so quickly, he plans to make a similar call for more gun control at a visit to a Colorado police academy on Wednesday. However, despite the president\'s ongoing effort to keep the campaign for reform alive, it seems increasingly unlikely that even some of the mildest federal gun control measures will pass. The NRA\'s lobbying efforts in Congress appear to be going over better than its disastrous public response to the Sandy Hook shooting, and the group is currently pushing language that would undercut the proposal to make gun trafficking a federal crime. <p>The Senate will start debating gun legislation when Congress returns from its two week Easter recess next week, and the Washington Post reports that senators are currently going over the legislative language with various interest groups, including the NRA and Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Last month the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a plan to increase penalties for straw purchases, or buying a gun for someone who can\'t pass a background check. According to the Post, NRA lobbyists are pushing a revision that would make it much harder to prosecute gun traffickers...</p> </blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://www.phillyburbs.com/news/local/the_intelligencer_news/opinion/congressional_voting_results/congress-has-poor-record-vs-nra-in-gun-control-debate/article_7b66b425-f92e-5c4f-8826-05bb132114ca.html">Richard G. Thomas</a> lays out the history of NRA control of Congress:</p>\n<blockquote>After Congress conducted no gun votes in 2012, the Senate last month handed the NRA a victory by blocking President Obama&rsquo;s nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. She crossed the NRA in 2003 by asserting that gun manufacturers could be sued for the misuse of their products by third parties. She was solicitor general for New York State at the time.<br> And in policy wins occurring without benefit of record votes and the accompanying public scrutiny, NRA-backed lawmakers in recent years have hemmed in the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives by steps such as limiting its budget, restricting its ability to gather records of gun sales and refusing to allow the Senate to confirm an AFT director. <p>Since passage of the assault weapons ban in 1994, the House and Senate have conducted at least 48 substantive votes on gun issues, with lawmakers aligned with the NRA winning about 80 percent of the time. On those rare occasions when a pro-control measure passed one chamber or the other, it was eliminated later in the legislative process.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><em>The Atlantic</em>\'s <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/04/great-gun-gobbledygook-the-paradox-of-second-amendment-hardliners/274523/">Dominic Tierney</a> on &quot;the great gun gobbledygook&quot; and how hardliners want more guns to protect themselves from the government while also wanting increased military spending:</p>\n<blockquote>The specter of government despotism looms so large our only salvation lies with a nation of armed watchmen. <p>But curiously, Rubio also strongly supports beefing up government power by creating a vast military establishment. In 2012, he described defense cuts as &quot;catastrophic&quot; because &quot;history has proven that the stronger the U.S. military is, the more peaceful the world becomes.&quot; According to Politico, in a recent speech at the University of Louisville, &quot;Rubio made the case for American military might around the world.&quot;</p> <p>Wait a sec, won\'t American military might mean a government that\'s in more places at more times? Isn\'t this precisely the terrifying prospect we must arm ourselves against? [...] It\'s almost like George Washington grasping his musket as a defense of liberty -- while also seeking extra funding for the British redcoats.</p> </blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://www.fair.org/blog/2013/04/01/did-the-public-really-give-up-on-gun-control/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=did-the-public-really-give-up-on-gun-control">Peter Hart</a> at FAIR points out that no, the public hasn\'t given up on gun control.</p>\n<p>Also, in case you missed it, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/bloomberg/article/Newtown-Parents-With-Child-Photos-Confront-4400877.php">this Bloomberg account of Newtown parents begging for common-sense gun control</a> by Annie Linskey is a must-read.</p>\n<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/04/01/obama-needs-backup-on-guns/">Jonathan Capehart</a> at <em>The Washington Post</em> puts it all in perspective:</p>\n<blockquote>Imagine how much could get done if Obama&rsquo;s consistent calls for help from the American people on gun violence were backed up by a consistent flood of calls to congressional district and Capitol Hill offices.

Last year, Chicago police confiscated 7,400 guns that were used in crimes or were illegally owned, but more firearms quickly arrived on the streets to replace them. Police Supt. Garry McCarthy has likened trying to stop the torrent to drinking out of a firehose.\nThe NRA opposes universal background checks. It helped push through a measure that prohibits the FBI from hanging on for longer than 24 hours to records of those who pass the existing background check system. That makes it hard to spot a pattern of straw purchases. Lawmakers should not be swayed by the NRA on this issue.\nWaiting for the U.S. Senate to act, though, is not enough. We need to act on the state level, too.\nHead below the fold for more analysis from papers across the country.\nCook County in Illinois is adding a $25 tax to all firearm purchases and is standing firm in the face of lawsuits:\nThe anticipated $600,000 in revenue from the new tax will help the county’s health and hospital system, Preckwinkle said. About 30 percent of trauma patients last year at Stroger Hospital were gunshot victims, she said, and each cost taxpayers about $52,000 to treat.\nLast month, a group of Chicago area firearms dealers and owners sued over the tax, claiming it violates their constitutional rights. Preckwinkle said that group failed to secure an injunction from a judge to temporarily stop the tax, and she said “we don’t calculate whether or not people are going to sue us when we look at reasonable gun policies.”\nAdam Clark Estes at The Atlantic looks at the NRA\'s next push:\nWhile it\'s no secret that the organization has perfected the art of lobbying over the years, they appear to have performed an opus of sorts on Capitol Hill in the past few weeks. Not only has the Senate bill been heavily diluted, but the NRA now has lawmakers parroting its points. Evidence actually suggests that the NRA might help kill the expanded background checks portion of the bill, despite the fact that it was one of the less controversial parts just a couple of months before. "We are in better shape now than our critics and even some within our ranks believed possible when this battle started," NRA president David Keene told The Huffington Post\'s Howard Fineman as this chapter was coming to a close late last month. All the while, folks like Hutchinson, who is also running for Governor in Arkansas, kept returning to this idea that the Obama administration and friends have a "hidden agenda" to take away everybody\'s guns.\nMargaret Hartmann at New York Magazine looks at the NRA\'s unrelenting assault on reasonable gun control measures:\nA week after President Obama suggested that we as a nation should be ashamed of ourselves for forgetting about the Newtown tragedy so quickly, he plans to make a similar call for more gun control at a visit to a Colorado police academy on Wednesday. However, despite the president\'s ongoing effort to keep the campaign for reform alive, it seems increasingly unlikely that even some of the mildest federal gun control measures will pass. The NRA\'s lobbying efforts in Congress appear to be going over better than its disastrous public response to the Sandy Hook shooting, and the group is currently pushing language that would undercut the proposal to make gun trafficking a federal crime.\nThe Senate will start debating gun legislation when Congress returns from its two week Easter recess next week, and the Washington Post reports that senators are currently going over the legislative language with various interest groups, including the NRA and Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Last month the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a plan to increase penalties for straw purchases, or buying a gun for someone who can\'t pass a background check. According to the Post, NRA lobbyists are pushing a revision that would make it much harder to prosecute gun traffickers...\nRichard G. Thomas lays out the history of NRA control of Congress:\nAfter Congress conducted no gun votes in 2012, the Senate last month handed the NRA a victory by blocking President Obama’s nomination of Caitlin J. Halligan for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. She crossed the NRA in 2003 by asserting that gun manufacturers could be sued for the misuse of their products by third parties. She was solicitor general for New York State at the time.\nAnd in policy wins occurring without benefit of record votes and the accompanying public scrutiny, NRA-backed lawmakers in recent years have hemmed in the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives by steps such as limiting its budget, restricting its ability to gather records of gun sales and refusing to allow the Senate to confirm an AFT director.\nSince passage of the assault weapons ban in 1994, the House and Senate have conducted at least 48 substantive votes on gun issues, with lawmakers aligned with the NRA winning about 80 percent of the time. On those rare occasions when a pro-control measure passed one chamber or the other, it was eliminated later in the legislative process.\nThe Atlantic\'s Dominic Tierney on "the great gun gobbledygook" and how hardliners want more guns to protect themselves from the government while also wanting increased military spending:\nThe specter of government despotism looms so large our only salvation lies with a nation of armed watchmen.\nBut curiously, Rubio also strongly supports beefing up government power by creating a vast military establishment. In 2012, he described defense cuts as "catastrophic" because "history has proven that the stronger the U.S. military is, the more peaceful the world becomes." According to Politico, in a recent speech at the University of Louisville, "Rubio made the case for American military might around the world."\nWait a sec, won\'t American military might mean a government that\'s in more places at more times? Isn\'t this precisely the terrifying prospect we must arm ourselves against? [...] It\'s almost like George Washington grasping his musket as a defense of liberty -- while also seeking extra funding for the British redcoats.\nPeter Hart at FAIR points out that no, the public hasn\'t given up on gun control.\nAlso, in case you missed it, this Bloomberg account of Newtown parents begging for common-sense gun control by Annie Linskey is a must-read.\nFinally, Jonathan Capehart at The Washington Post puts it all in perspective:\nImagine how much could get done if Obama’s consistent calls for help from the American people on gun violence were backed up by a consistent flood of calls to congressional district and Capitol Hill offices. The president has done as much as he can possibly do. With the Senate set to consider anti-gun-violence bills next week, where’s his backup?

Americans for Responsible Solutions, the organization founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ) and her husband Mark Kelly, has released a new TV ad in the campaign to curb gun violence.\n"We have a problem -- where we shop, where we pray, where our children go to school," Giffords says in the ad. "But there are solutions we can agree on, even gun owners like us. Take it from me: Congress must act. Let\'s get this done."\nThe ad -- at a six-figure buy -- will air this week in DC, as well in the cities represented by congressional leaders: San Francisco (Nancy Pelosi); Cincinnati, OH (John Boehner); Louisville, KY (Mitch McConnell); and Las Vegas, NV (Harry Reid).\nAnd it comes after Giffords and her husband recently sat down with the New York Times for an interview. "Ms. Giffords, a former Democratic congresswoman from Arizona, a gun owner, an astronaut’s wife, a shooting survivor and an incipient gun-control advocate, is settling into the third act of her public life. Her career as a lawmaker is behind her, but so is her role as the fragile, slightly mysterious victim in the months after she was shot point-blank in a parking lot here just over two years ago. Now, she is the face and emotional dynamism behind a new advocacy group and a separate political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, dedicated to reducing gun violence. It is an effort, she said, that gives her \'purpose.\'"\nGiffords and Kelly also will attend President Obama\'s State of the Union on Tuesday.\nPopular Discussio

WASHINGTON -- The head of the National Rifle Assn. expressed confidence Sunday that the current Congress will not pass a new ban on assault weapons, a major aim of gun-control proponents in the wake of last month’s killing of 20 schoolchildren in Connecticut.\n“I would say that the likelihood is that they are not going to be able to get assault weapons ban through this Congress,” NRA President David Keene said on CNN’s “State Of The Union.”\nKeene’s comments come two days before Vice President Joe Biden is expected to issue a series of recommendations to President Obama on reducing gun violence, and as gun stores in many areas report a dramatic spike in sales.\nBiden’s focus has been on requiring universal background checks for gun sales and on limiting sales of high-capacity ammunition clips, two areas that appear to have widespread public support.\nBut administration officials have indicated that a ban on assault weapons could be included in an overall package of proposals. Obama has endorsed renewing such a ban, which was passed by Congress in 1994 but expired a decade later.\nCongress is exhibiting new energy to restrict production and sales of certain firearms, with some pro-gun members speaking out for the first time against the spread of assault weapons.\nBut it’s far from clear if there’s enough support, particularly among Republicans, to approve a broad ban on such type of military-style guns.\n“I think we have the possibility, but it’s going to be difficult,” said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) on CNN. He said prospects were better for Congress to push through restrictions on high-capacity magazines and expanded background checks.\nBiden met with NRA officials last week as part of his efforts to reach out to all sides on the issue, but Keene described the meeting as disingenuous, saying that the administration had already made up its mind.\nKeene insisted that new measures on assault weapons, as well as on high-volume magazines, would be ineffective in preventing gun violence, arguing instead that the focus should be on mentally ill people and curbing their ability to acquire guns.\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) on Sunday sharply disagreed with Keene’s assessment that the current Congress would not take action on assault weapons.\n“No, I think he’s wrong,” Murphy said on CNN. Saying that he believed such a ban would have prevented the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., Murphy said: “Newtown fundamentally changed things. The NRA doesn’t get this.”

Alex: Prince William is desperately sad that the close relationship he once enjoyed with Prince Harry has soured, it was claimed by a friend last night. The Duke of Cambridge has said he is unable to even 'put an arm round' his younger brother nowadays, after a rift saw them drift apart over the past year. Harry and Meghan's intention to quit as senior Royals has widened the gulf between the two siblings, with William understood to be 'incandescent' over his brother's blindsiding of the Family. But as the brothers gear up to come face-to-face at the Queen's high-stakes crisis summit at Sandringham on Monday, the second-in-line to the throne confided in a friend his raw agony over the cracked sibling bond. He said: 'I've put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can't do that any more - we're separate entities,' according to the Sunday Times. William also spoke of his frustration that Harry is no longer part of the 'team' by deciding to become 'financially independent' in a pared-back Royal role. Yet hees that there will 'come a time' when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be 'singing from the same page' once again. The Queen, who was pictured ashen-faced behind the wheel of her Land Rover today, is also said to be concerned for the mental fragility of her grandson Harry. It also emerged the Duke of Sussex pulled the trigger on his abdication decision because he feared his wife, who had not settled well in the UK, was 'on the brink' and could suffer a meltdown if she remained in the country permanently. Anxious to avoid exacerbating an already tense situation, the Royal Family is keen to tread carefully. A source said: 'There is no suggestion that they will be punished or stripped of their Royal titles or HRH status. Everyone wants to find a solution to this as quickly as possible.' After laying down a 72-hour ultimatum to aides on Friday to hammer out a solution to the Sussexes' future roles, Her Majesty summoned Princes Charles, William and Harry to her Norfolk Estate to put an end to the turmoil ravaging the monarchy - while Meghan is expected to join the discussions via a conference call from Canada.....

I\'ve been told that here we are a "reality-based community." I do see some signs of that as finally, after years of outright hostility towards people who were trying to point out that the Democratic party establishment is on the take by the same moneyed corporatists cartels that own the Republican party establishment, more and more kossacks are beginning to accept that obvious fact.\nBut there is a topic I want to check on to assess whether we are actually making enough progress when it comes to being a "reality-based" community. I\'ll keep it short, since I think it is pretty straightforward...\nYou do know that so-called stand-your-ground, concealed-carry, "castle-doctrine," and many other laws and regulations having to do with arming the population to the teeth have been pushed by corporatist business cartels like ALEC, and the gun industry, and the myriad astroturf front groups and think tanks they fund, right?\nNow, you may ask, "why would \'business\' groups, or corporatist cartels would put so much effort on arming the population?"\nLet\'s get a couple of facts out the way: The U.S. is in the final stages of a transition towards a plutocratic corporatocracy. I\'m going to save space here and instead recommend these three information resources as support to this statement: "America Is Ruled by Billionaires, and They Are Coming After the Last Shreds of Our Democracy," Lawrence Lessig: We the People, and the Republic we must reclaim.\nAnd by now, you must also be aware about the fact that the entire U.S. mainstream media has the overall effect of a mind-numbing propaganda machine that serves the interests of the corrupt ruling class by spreading lies, misinformation, and false narratives. I\'ll direct you to this information resource: "America\'s Sell Out Intellectuals and the Perks They Get."\nNow, after getting that out of the way, hopefully by now you see where I\'m going since if those two facts are accepted as such, then the rest is easy to understand...\nThe ruling elite is currently engaging in a massive looting and pillaging of the country\'s wealth, mainly by increasingly exploiting and subjugating the citizenry.\nWhatever is left of democracy is being systematically dismantled, along with our constitutional rights. The proper functioning of government is being purposely atrophied by a well-planned and systematic de-funding strategy.\nThat\'s where all the talk about "entitlement" reforms and "austerity" is coming from.\nAs this happens, the social safety net is dismantled, and with it, the social fabric starts to unravel.\nEventually this creates a siege mentality on affected groups, starting with the very poor and dispossessed, followed by those who are near poverty, and up the economic ladder.\nThis eventually exacerbates divisions based on economic class, ethnicity, religious beliefs, etc...\nWhen conditions get sufficiently bad (due to increased austerity policies, which by the way, are being imposed on purpose), once you flood communities with guns, and once you put in place a regime of laws that expand the justification for justifiable homicides, then you\'ve created the perfect conditions for people to start shooting at each other.\nOnce people start shooting and getting away with it, then the business cartels keep pushing more and more boiler-plate laws expanding the justification for more shootings.\nEventually this will bring about a situation where you will have mainly right wing groups across the country armed to the teeth, emboldened to intimidate social justice activists as the conditions deteriorate due to the imposition of austerity, i.e., purposely defunding the proper functioning of government (of the the people and by the people).\nWhat\'s behind all this? That\'s also pretty straightforward. What these fascistic business cartels are doing is taking down the regulatory infrastructure, the social safety net, and etc., in order to eventually align labor costs to those of developing countries. Yes, folks, it\'s about money; it\'s about putting a fascist boot on your neck, figuratively and literally.\nSo there you have it. That\'s what\'s happening.\nNow, some people may refuse to believe that there could be people so evil as to purposely and systematically help in bringing about the conditions for this type of mayhem.\nThink again. These billionaires funding this stuff are as much as fascists thugs as any other tyrant in history.\nYou haven\'t seen half of what these people are capable of--yet.

Rep. Jeff Duncan%2C R-S.C.%2C has been aggressive in trying to lure firms\nA Colorado ammunition manufacturer has been targeted by states\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry has written to at least 13 companies\nStates claiming to be friendly to the Second Amendment are trying to poach gun and ammunition makers and related manufacturers from other states, especially those that have passed or are contemplating tougher gun laws.\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, this month has written at least 13 manufacturers in states from Oregon to New York saying his state would not impose "unwarranted government intrusion into your business."\nRep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., has written manufacturers in New York and Colorado inviting them to relocate. Idaho economic development officials and Mississippi\'s Republican speaker of the House also have written similar letters.\n"The enemies of freedom are waging an all-out assault on the Second Amendment to the Constitution, which we have sworn to protect and defend," said Duncan\'s letter to George Kollitides, chief executive officer of Freedom Group Inc., whose Remington Arms division has a manufacturing plant in Ilion, N.Y. "At a time when our government is consistently thwarting the ability of individuals to own businesses, voluntarily trade goods and services, and grow our economy, South Carolina is committed to a different story. In South Carolina, we believe in the right to keep and bear arms."\nDuncan also wrote the chief operating officer of Magpul, a Colorado company that makes ammunition magazines, gun stocks and other custom add-ons for semi-automatic rifles that President Obama and some members of Congress, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., want to ban. Colorado\'s legislature is contemplating several gun-control measures, including limiting ammunition magazines to 15 rounds.\nWhen the legislation first came to light, Magpul officials told the Denver Post they would consider leaving the state if the measure to limit rounds in magazines became law, saying it would be difficult doing business in a state that banned its products. Other companies that supply Magpul have since said they would follow if Magpul left.\nRepeated attempts to reach Magpul officials were unsuccessful. So were attempts to reach a spokesperson for Remington Arms, which was founded in upstate New York but is now headquartered in North Carolina.\nNew York last month passed one of the most restrictive gun laws in the nation, which among other things banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. When he signed it, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, stressed that the new restrictions would not affect rifles and shotguns used by hunters.\nIn an interview, Duncan said that was not the point.\n"This isn\'t about deer hunting," he said. "The Second Amendment is about our right to keep and bear arms to defend ourselves."\nRob Godfrey, a spokesman for South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a Republican, said that "while we appreciate Congressman Duncan\'s leadership and economic development efforts, we don\'t discuss details of ongoing talks with any company that may be interested in moving to South Carolina."\nThe Colorado House has passed several gun-related measures, including limiting ammunition magazines to 15 rounds. Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, has said he would sign such legislation if it passes the state Senate.\nEric Brown, a spokesman for Hickenlooper, said that if a company left the state because of gun restrictions, "that would be unfortunate.\n"But Colorado is growing," he said. "We are adding a lot of jobs."\nOne company approached by Perry, the Texas governor, already has said no.\nCrimson Trace Corp. of Wilsonville, Ore., which makes laser-sighting systems for handguns, will stay put. Kent Thomas, director of marketing for the company, said the firm is happy with the "entrepreneurial spirit of Oregon" and that "there is no reason for us to move."\nBills to ban the sale of high-capacity magazines and assault rifles were introduced in the Oregon legislature but they have stalled. State Sen. Floyd Prozanski, a Democrat and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said last week he would not take up either bill because they were issues that Congress should deal with.\nSome states that have robust outdoors industries have been trying to attract gun and ammunition manufacturers for years.\nEven before the most recent escalation in the gun-violence debate following the murder of 20 children and six adults in December in Newtown, Conn., Idaho was trying to attract companies "not only within the arms and ammunition sector, but broader — companies that fall within what we call recreational technology," said Megan Ronk, spokeswoman for the Idaho Department of Commerce. The best way to explain the state\'s business targets, she said: makers of any products sold at Cabela\'s, a leading outdoors, hunting and fishing retailer.\nRonk said that as other states consider gun restrictions, "that creates some advantages for us. We in this state have traditionally been very friendly to companies within this industry, and will continue to be so. Certainly looking at other states that are imposing more restrictive laws" is part of a business-recruitment strategy.\nContributing: Associated Press

ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Handgun holstered on his hip, Anthony Triemert showed up to Minnesota\'s Capitol on Friday for the latest in a number of recent legislative hearings on various gun control proposals.\n"I just came down here today to show support for Second Amendment rights," he said. But Triemert\'s right to carry a loaded gun is safe in this building. Minnesota is one of at least nine states that allow people to carry guns into the brick-and-mortar homes of government.\nAll he and other Minnesotans have to do is notify the Minnesota Department of Public Safety in advance. As hundreds of pro-gun activists have streamed into the state\'s legislative hearings on gun controls, such notifications have spiked in the last month — almost 1/5th of all notifications given since the current permit law took effect in 2006.\nBetween Jan. 18 and Feb. 22, 150 people notified DPS of the intent to carry their weapons on the Capitol complex. By contrast, only 56 such notifications were filed in all of 2012. And since the law took effect, a total of 723 individuals have notified the agency.\nOn Friday, gun rights activists again came out in force for the second day of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Most of them didn\'t wear their guns openly like Triemert, though he was not the only one. An auto mechanic from Brooklyn Park who\'s now on disability, Triemert said he wears the gun almost everywhere he goes.\n"I don\'t believe in gun safe zones. I think it\'s an advertisement for a killing zone," Triemert said, noting he carries a weapon for protection because of his own physical limitations.\nPrivate establishments in Minnesota are allowed to post signs stating that guns are not allowed on the premises. But no such rules are in place at the Capitol, which has no metal detectors at its public entrances.\n"I don\'t like people carrying weapons in the Capitol," said Sen. Barb Goodwin, DFL-Columbia Heights, a Judiciary Committee member and outspoken gun control supporter. "This is a place where controversial decisions are made all the time. Emotions can run high."

Well you can count out one local law-enforcement agent who\'s not buying the executive actions just signed at the White House or any potential new gun legislation to come. An Oregon sheriff is citing his constitutional duty in accusing politicians of "attempting to exploit the deaths of innocent victims" to enact new gun laws that he thinks would harm his law-abiding locals. Linn County Sheriff Tim Mueller has promised not to enforce any new gun laws enacted in the wake of the Newtown shootings, making him pretty much the gun-rights hero of a very big day for pro-gun America. The reason we\'re hearing so much from this obscure sheriff is that he sent a letter to Vice-President Joe Biden and shared it with multiple news outlets like the Associated Press. There are two main kernels from his complaint — the first implies that politicians are exploiting the Newtown massacre:\nAnd here\'s Mueller\'s promise not to enact what he deems "unconstitutional" new gun laws and "actions," such as the 23 President Obama just signed into law:\nSomewhere in an undisclosed location, the powerful people behind the National Rifle Association are smiling. Mueller\'s points aren\'t unlike Wayne LaPierre\'s and the NRA\'s talking points — that the 2nd Amendment is very important, that there are good guys with the guns, and that good guys need guns to protect themselves with bad guys with guns. And Mueller\'s comments bear a close resemblance to New York State Senator Greg Ball, who admonished the state\'s newly passed and very tough regulations on Tuesday. Ball said:\nI simply cannot support a bill that turns law abiding citizens into criminals by creating an entire new category of illegal firearms out of currently legal rifles and shotguns,” said Senator Greg Ball.\nAnd Sheriff Mueller is already lauded on social media, by gun rights advocate, and alongside the conservative press. He\'s a hit on Breitbart:\nBut despite his gun-rights fan base, Mueller\'s views don\'t represent all of America. An AP poll found that nearly "six in 10 Americans want stricter gun laws in the aftermath of last month’s deadly school shooting in Connecticut" and "84 percent of adults would like to see the establishment of a federal standard for background checks for people buying guns at gun shows, the poll showed."\nHere\'s Mueller\'s full letter:

WASHINGTON (AP) — Several people whose lives have been shattered by gun violence will be watching from the packed House gallery as President Barack Obama gives his State of the Union speech.\nBut not Bill Sherlach, whose wife, Mary, was killed in the school shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14.\nWashington officials fighting over gun control invited him to attend Obama\'s speech Tuesday night in the House chamber. Sherlach declined.\nHe said that rather than be the nationally televised face of tragedy, he prefers working within a group that wants the gun issue addressed as part of a comprehensive effort to reduce violence. He wants to work with Sandy Hook Promise, a group that deals with more than just gun control. Mary Sherlach was the Sandy Hook Elementary School psychologist.\nSherlach, who said he had other obligations the day of the speech, explained he also didn\'t want to be part of the heated rift over gun control that politics and dueling news conferences seem to inflame.\n"I think the political aspect pulls people to one extreme or the other extreme," he said.\nRep. Jim Himes, Sherlach\'s congressman in Connecticut, had invited him to the president\'s address.\nVictims of tragedy long have played major roles in the nation\'s most dramatic public policy debates, and there are few more bitter, or expensive than this year\'s legislative battle over gun control. Victims make riveting witnesses to wrenching problems and the consequences of doing nothing to prevent the nightmares they know.\nThe age of global multimedia sharing, however, opens them as never before to becoming pawns and targets in fights that can be more about the legacies and ambitions of others than their own lost loved ones.\nUnfortunately, there\'s no shortage of gun victims in a nation that saw nearly 8,600 gun violence deaths in 2011, according to the FBI, or of politicians looking for real people to bolster their positions on gun control, mental health and other issues. There still will be representatives from Newtown in the House gallery for Obama\'s prime-time speech.\nAfter a gunman shot his own mother at home and then 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook, Obama pledged to tighten gun laws. And then came a parade of the sorrowful and the defiant filing through the virtual public square.\nAt the White House, Obama met with Newtown families. At a public hearing in Connecticut, Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son, Jesse, was killed at the school, questioned the need for any civilian to own semi-automatic, military-style weapons. "The Second Amendment shall not be infringed!" someone shouted back.\nIn Washington, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shot to the head during a 2011 assassination attempt, told a Senate committee that Congress must revamp gun laws. Her husband, Mark Kelly, got into a terse discussion at the witness table with National Rifle Association\'s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre.\nAt the Super Bowl, the Sandy Hook Elementary School chorus gave a stirring rendition of "America the Beautiful" that had some players on the sidelines and fans in the stands in tears.\nThe State of the Union address will showcase the results of intense campaigns by the White House and members of Congress to bring victims of gun violence, including some Newtown families, to the Capitol.\nCleopatra and Nathaniel Pendleton, the parents of a Chicago teenager slain just days after performing during Obama\'s inauguration, will sit with first lady Michelle Obama during the speech. Hadiya Pendleton, 15, was shot to death Jan. 29 in a park close to the Obama\'s Chicago home. Police say a gunman hopped a fence and opened fire on a group of young people. She was a majorette with the King College Prep band.\nTwenty-four House members are bringing people affected by gun violence, according to Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., who spearheaded the effort. The guests include Natalie Hammond, Sandy Hook\'s lead teacher, who was shot in the foot, leg and hand but managed to crawl to safety behind a door. She\'ll be the guest of Rep. Elizabeth Esty, D-Conn.\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., will have as her guest a fourth-grader who attends a different elementary school in Newtown, but recently wrote to her about gun control.\n"To have them in the gallery during the speech is a strong reminder to Congress that the American people want action on these issues," said Langevin, who has used a wheelchair since being paralyzed in a shooting accident as a teen.\nLangevin was a 16-year-old Boy Scout cadet working with police in Warwick, R.I. He was in a locker room watching officers examine a gun they thought was unloaded, when the weapon accidentally fired. A bullet ricocheted off a metal locker and severed Langevin\'s spinal cord.\nTaking sides on the gun issue while coping with grief can be a stunning and disillusioning experience, say veterans of victim advocacy.\n"Families are not prepared to go through the onslaught," said John Walsh, host and executive producer of TV\'s "America\'s Most Wanted" show, who began his crime-busting crusade after the abduction and murder of his 6-year-old son, Adam, in 1981. Victims\' relatives, he said, can get frustrated when their activism doesn\'t translate into swift action.\n"They\'re not prepared for all the shenanigans in Congress," said Walsh. But, he added, some good could come from Sandy Hook. "There is a tiny window here before everybody forgets about it. This could be a great time for these parents to make a loud statement."\nIn his speech, Obama is expected to urge support for his plan to ban assault weapons and require background checks for all gun buyers. Last month he released his package of proposals for curbing gun violence in response to the Newtown shootings and vowed to use the powers of his office to fight for the proposals.\nMost of them face tough opposition from the NRA and its friends in Congress. Conservative accused Obama of using children as political props. When he announced his gun proposals at the White House, he was surrounded by some kids who had written him in support of further gun restrictions.\nWhile no family wants to be exploited, many in Newtown want to have a role in seeing something come of the tragedy, said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.\nTheir testimony, she said, "puts a tangible human face on the issue."\nJim Tyrell, a Warwick, R.I., bartender whose older sister, Debbie, was shot and killed nine years ago during a robbery at the convenience store she owned, said he\'s attending Obama\'s speech as Langevin\'s guest.\n"Somebody took her life with a gun, and here I am trying to save another person\'s life by getting guns off the streets," he said.\nTyrell said he\'s not daunted by the prospect of public criticism. "If somebody criticizes me, that is their opinion. I am not looking to offend anybody else, I just want to tell them my story and what happened to our family."\n___\nMelia reported from Hartford, Conn.

Connecticut lawmakers reached a bipartisan deal Monday on what they consider some of the toughest gun laws in the country and hope will be a model for other capitals, pushing to expand the state\'s assault-weapons ban and impose new restrictions on high-capacity magazines.\nThe proposal came hours ahead of the release late Tuesday morning of the National Rifle Association\'s report on school safety proposals. The NRA commissioned the study in the wake of the Newtown shooting, as the group pushed for enhanced school security rather than measures to curb gun ownership.\nThe Connecticut deal, by contrast, focuses on gun control measures -- though it left some on both sides of the debate unhappy. Gun control advocates, and particularly families of those killed or injured in the December Newtown shooting, were disappointed the proposal only included a ban on new high-capacity magazines -- and not existing ones.\nAnd gun-rights groups argued that the latest proposal would not have prevented the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n"They can register magazines and do all the rest of this stuff. It isn\'t going to do anything," said Robert Crook, executive director of the Connecticut Coalition of Sportsmen.\nGun owners, who\'ve packed public hearings at the state Capitol in recent months, voicing their opposition to various gun control measures, are concerned they\'ve been showing up "for virtually nothing" after learning about the bill, Crook said.\n"Clearly we\'ve made our point," Crook said. "But I don\'t know what anybody can do at this point in time."\nConnecticut lawmakers announced a deal Monday which would include a ban on new high-capacity ammunition magazines like the ones used in the massacre that left 20 children and six educators dead. The proposal includes new registration requirements for existing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets.\nThe package also creates what lawmakers said is the nation\'s first statewide dangerous weapon offender registry, creates a new "ammunition eligibility certificate," imposes immediate universal background checks for all firearms sales, and extends the state\'s assault weapons ban to 100 new types of firearms and requires that a weapon have only one of several features in order to be banned.\nThe newly banned weapons could no longer be bought or sold in Connecticut, and those legally owned already would have to be registered with the state, just like the high-capacity magazines.\n"No gun owner will lose their gun," said House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero Jr., a Norwalk Republican. "No gun owner will lose their magazines."\nThe bill also addresses mental health and school security measures.\nThe shooting Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School reignited the gun debate in the country and led to calls for increased gun control legislation on the federal and state levels. While some other states, including neighboring New York, have strengthened their gun laws, momentum has stalled in Congress, whose members were urged by President Obama last week not to forget the shooting and to capitalize on the best chance in years to stem gun violence.\nConnecticut should be seen as an example for lawmakers elsewhere, said Senate President Donald E. Williams Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat.\n"In Connecticut, we\'ve broken the mold," he said. "Democrats and Republicans were able to come to an agreement on a strong, comprehensive bill. That is a message that should resound in 49 other states and in Washington, D.C. And the message is: We can get it done here and they should get it done in their respective states and nationally in Congress."\nThe proposal was revealed to rank-and-file lawmakers Monday after weeks of bipartisan, closed-door negotiations among legislative leaders. A vote was expected Wednesday in the General Assembly, where Democrats control both chambers, making passage all but assured. The bill would then be sent to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who has helped lead efforts to strengthen the state\'s gun laws but has not yet signed off on the proposed legislation.\nEarlier in the day on Monday, Malloy voiced support for the Newtown families and their desire to ban the possession of large-capacity magazines.\nRon Pinciaro, executive director of Connecticut Against Gun Violence, said his group will live with the lawmakers\' decision not to ban them as other states have done. He said the leaders made their decision based on what was politically feasible.\n"We have to be satisfied. There are still other things that we want, we\'ll be back for in later sessions," he said. "But for now, it\'s a good thing."\nSix relatives of Newtown victims visited the Capitol on Monday, asking lawmakers to ban existing high-capacity magazines. Some handed out cards with photographs of their slain children.\nAllowing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets to remain in the hands of gun owners would leave a gaping loophole in the law, said Mark Barden, whose 7-year-old son, Daniel, was killed in the shooting.\n"It doesn\'t prevent someone from going out of the state to purchase them and then bring them back. There\'s no way to track when they were purchased, so they can say, `I had this before,"\' Barden said. "So it\'s a big loophole."\nJake McGuigan, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is based in Newtown, said he wouldn\'t comment on the proposal until he saw it in the writing, but he questioned the mechanics of a registry for magazines.\n"How will they register a magazine? It seems a little weird," he said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

(David Horsey / Los Angeles Times)\nYes, it always seems to come down to that –- the paranoid certainty that even the most modest move toward better gun regulation is actually a smokescreen for some tyrant-in-waiting who wants to banish guns and enslave America. That prevalent view among gun rights advocates pushes some of them to accept even loopier ideas.

If you\'ve followed the gun-control debate at all, you may have heard recently that support for stricter laws has fallen significantly in the past three-and-a-half months as the 12/14 slaughter in Newtown, Connecticut, fades from public memory. That claim, trumpeted by cable television, National Review, talk shows and comment threads, is, however, based on two polls, most particularly a CBS News poll showing only 47 percent now in favor of stricter gun-control measures compared with 57 percent in December.\nThere are three problems with this assessment.\nFirst: it\'s one poll. A Marist poll (commissioned by MSNBC\'s "Morning Joe" program) was released early Wednesday showing 60 percent of Americans replying "more strict" to the question: Do you think the laws covering the sale of firearms should be more strict, less strict, or kept as they are now?\nThat\'s not all. The fact is, the generic strict versus less-strict versus stay-as-they-are questions always elicit weaker support than more specific questions.\nAs the Center for American Progress has noted in a comprehensive look at this matter:\nOne of the most consistent findings in gun polling is that support for “gun control” broadly is lower than support for specific tighter gun laws. One reason is the lack of specificity in broad “gun climate” questions. What do respondents think of when asked whether they support “gun control” or “stricter laws covering the sale of firearms”? Are they thinking about a ban on all guns, including hunting rifles? Are they thinking about preventing people accused of domestic violence from getting a gun at a gun show without a background check and then bringing that gun across state lines? We simply don’t know. This is not to say that a broad question on attitudes toward gun laws can’t be useful, but we should simply understand its limitations.\nHere\'s what else was asked in that CBS News poll in the third week of March which found the drop in support for stricter gun control:\nDo you favor or oppose a nationwide ban on semi-automatic weapons—including some rifles, pistols, and shotguns—that have detachable magazines, allowing them to rapidly fire a high number of rounds?"\nA total of 49 percent in favor, 49 percent opposed. That\'s a downward shift of three points from February, which is the same as the margin of error. Also asked:\n"Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?"\nA total of 90 percent in favor, 8 percent opposed. In February, the figure was 91 percent.\nWhat\'s clear when you look at all the polls is that while there has been some slippage when questions about specific measures are asked, it is marginal. The majority of Americans still want universal background checks, an assault weapons ban and a limit on the capacity of gun magazines.

This is not a movie. There\'s no dramatic music in the background. A happy ending, far from a guarantee.\nThe concern in Donnie Herman\'s voice was clear as day. So was his stress. With two telephones to his ear, he listened to his wife, Melinda, as she fled into an attic of their Loganville home. With her: Her two 9-year-old children and a loaded .38 revolver.\nOn another line was the 911 operator Donnie Herman had called for help. Herman\'s words to his wife, as he sat helplessly, an hour away from the home, were recorded.\nWhat happened next has made the Hermans the new faces of the right to bear arms.\nMelinda Herman fired a six-shot revolver at the intruder, hitting him five times, in his torso and in his face. Surprisingly, he managed to flee.\nGun rights groups say this shows that law-abiding citizens should be allowed to buy their weapon of choice and as big a magazine or ammunition clip as they like.\n"It\'s a good thing she wasn\'t facing more attackers. Otherwise she would have been in trouble and she would have run out of ammunition," said Erich Pratt, director of communications for the Gun Owners of America.\n"She shot him five times and he still didn\'t drop. This is going to endanger people\'s safety."\nThis week, a federal task force led by Vice President Joe Biden is holding talks with private industry groups, the NRA, and legislators -- all to determine the correct balance between the right to self-protection and preventing further mass shootings.\nMeanwhile, Americans are flocking to gun shops to buy guns and ammunition in record numbers -- partly due to Newtown and partly due to their fears that the rules are about to change on what they can legally own.\nThe FBI said it conducted almost 2.8 million checks for gun purchases in December, a record high for a month.\nDonnie and Melinda Herman own two guns for protection at home, but until two weeks ago, she had never fired a gun. Her husband told sheriff\'s department investigator\'s that he took her shooting so that she\'d be familiar with the family\'s guns if she ever had to use one.\nNow, clutching the .38 revolver, Melinda Herman was in the middle of a heart-pounding crisis inside her own home.\nShe had already locked multiple doors before she and her children took refuge in an adjacent-room attic -- the kind with a small door that you have to bend down to go through.\nThe intruder had used the crowbar to break through the front door and then two other doors upstairs, and she could hear him coming closer and closer.\nOn the phone, Donnie Herman calmly instructed his wife about the use of the weapon she had practiced on.\n"Remember everything I showed you. Everything I taught you," he told her, and he reassured her that help was on the way.\n"She shot him. She\'s shooting him. She\'s shooting him. She\'s shooting him. She\'s shooting him. ... Shoot him again! Shoot him!" Donnie Herman said as the 911 dispatcher listened.\nHe then lost phone contact with his wife and children. His anguish and the pain of not knowing what had happened may be etched in his mind for eternity. But they were safe.\nHe learned later that his wife fired all six shots, and hit the intruder with all but one bullet.\nNot realizing she was out of ammunition, she ordered the man to stay on the floor as he bled. She then fled the house with her children.\nWalton County Sheriff Joe Chapman -- whose office responded to the shooting at the Hermans\' home -- said he believes the mother and her two children were in a life-and-death situation and she had no choice but to exercise her constitutional right to self-defense.\n"Had it not turned out the way that it did, I would possibly be working a triple homicide, not having a clue as to who it is we\'re looking for," he told CNN.\nDespite being shot five times, the suspect, identified as Paul Ali Slater, still managed to get back into his SUV, but he drove off the road and crashed a short distance away.\nThe Hermans\' story of self-defense is being used by the National Rifle Association and the Gun Owners of America to make their point to the White House and Congress about gun ownership.\nBut Donnie Herman has told people he\'s not interested in being a poster boy for anyone. He has not yet responded to CNN\'s request for an interview with him and his wife.\nYet it\'s unclear whether the benefits of having a loaded and readily available gun in one\'s home outweigh the drawbacks.\n"It\'s more common for an armed homeowner in the United States to be a victim of suicide, homicide, assault or an accidental shooting than it is for that person to shoot an intruder," according to Dr. Arthur Kellermann, a senior health policy analyst at Rand Corporation, a non-partisan think tank.\nKellermann led research for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the 1990s which found that people who have guns in their homes are nearly three times more likely to be a victim of homicide and nearly five times more likely to commit suicide.\nExperts also say that simply having a gun for self-protection does not guarantee safety. They say the fear is that many people will take part in what might be considered a feeding frenzy by purchasing a gun, but not learn how to properly use it.\n"I often tell people, \'If you don\'t think that you have what it takes to take a human life then don\'t bother buying one. Don\'t waste your money. Don\'t waste your time," he told CNN.

(AP)\nHARTFORD, Conn. – A national gun industry association based in Connecticut is withdrawing its support for federal legislation that would establish the Coltsville National Historical Park in Hartford, citing recent passage of the state\'s new gun control law.\nIn letters to the state\'s congressional delegation and governor, Lawrence G. Keane, the senior vice president and general counsel of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said the industry is "offended by the hypocrisy of our elected officials in Congress and the state government" to advocate for legislation paying homage to the firearms industry and the iconic Colt firearms factory while pursuing gun control legislation.\n"As major contributors to the state\'s economy, we find it unacceptable for lawmakers to propose banning our products and hindering our ability of Connecticut companies to grow their businesses, create more good-paying manufacturing jobs, and contribute hundreds of millions in taxes," Keane wrote in the letters released Tuesday.\nHe called the state\'s legislation "job-killing" because it bans many of the most popular and commonly owned firearms that the foundation\'s members manufacture.\nCurrent and past delegation members have pushed for years for the National Historical Park designation at Coltsville, an area named after Samuel Colt, who designed a revolver that revolutionized personal firearms. The area includes manufacturing facilities and employee housing that his Colt Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Co. began building in 1855.\nColtsville was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2008, a step toward the national park designation.\nU.S. Rep. John Larson, a Democrat who represents Hartford and a chief proponent of the national historical park designation, said the site is of national historic significance and "anyone who understands the significance and importance of Coltsville gets it." He said the location was and will remain the cradle of the Industrial Revolution, the site of precision manufacturing, assembly line production and interchangeable parts.\n"Historic designation has nothing to do with universal background checks, which 91 percent of the American people support," Larson said.\nThe foundation is based in Newtown, the site of the Dec. 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It filed a federal lawsuit on Monday claiming the state\'s emergency gun control bill was illegally passed in April without proper public input, time for adequate review by lawmakers and without a statement of facts explaining the need to bypass the usual

Congress is about as likely to impose firecracker control after a man lobbed some at the White House on Monday as lawmakers are to tighten gun laws after the slaughter of 12 people at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., only a few hours earlier.\nThat’s the grim feeling among profoundly frustrated gun-control advocates and their Democratic allies on Capitol Hill. They say privately that if the Christmastime massacre of 20 schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., last year couldn’t spur action on modest steps to combat gun violence, what chance does the killing of a dozen adults have?\n"We don’t have the votes. I hope to get them, but we don’t have them now," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday when asked if the Senate would revisit a bill to tighten background checks after Monday\'s shootings. The Senate rejected a similar measure in April.\nThat measure failed by five votes — Reid switched his “yes” vote to “no” in a procedural move that permits him to bring the proposal up again. On Tuesday, Reid said that he might consider revisiting a separate, limited bill that would exclusively address mental health issues.\n“Anything we can do to focus attention on the senseless killings that take place,” Reid said. “That’s something we will look at.”\nOn Monday, the tone of frustration with Congress\' inaction on gun legislation came from the very top, as President Barack Obama deplored that “we are confronting yet another mass shooting.”\n“We\'re going to be investigating thoroughly what happened, as we do so many of these shootings, sadly, that have happened, and do everything that we can to try to prevent them,” he added.\nObama made no mention of another push in Congress — and White House press secretary Jay Carney added to the impression of congressional stalemate at his briefing not long afterward.\n“We will continue to work to take action to reduce gun violence in this country through executive action, and hopefully Congress will take action to reduce gun violence as well,” Carney told reporters.

NEW YORK—New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the media need to improve their coverage of gun violence, arguing the press pays attention to gun-related deaths only after mass shootings.\nIn an interview with NBC’s Jimmy Fallon, Bloomberg called the Dec. 14 shooting that killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., “terribly tragic,” but said there is scant coverage of people who are killed by guns every day.\n“This was a crazy person with an assault weapon,” Bloomberg said of the Sandy Hook shooting. “But there’s 33 people killed in America with guns every single day of the year. And nobody seems to care. It only catches the press’s attention when it’s young kids concentrated. And it was terribly tragic, but there are kids killed every day all across this country.”\nBloomberg has emerged as one of the most vocal advocates of new gun-control measures since the Sandy Hook shooting, urging President Barack Obama to make the issue a top priority in his second term. But the mayor insisted he’s not trying to ban guns, telling Fallon that “if you are responsible and you are adult and you don’t have a criminal record, there’s nothing wrong with you having a gun.”\nThe problem, Bloomberg said, is that Congress doesn’t “fund enforcement” of existing gun laws and “guns are getting into the hands of the wrong people.”\n“There’s just too many guns in the world and certainly in this country,” Bloomberg said. “And we’ve just got to do something about it.”\nThe mayor discussed his meeting Wednesday with former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot at point-blank range and nearly killed during a constituent meeting two years ago. Giffords, who is set to visit Newtown today, resigned from Congress to focus on recovery.\n“She's still recovering. She’s still doing therapy and yoga and struggling to learn to speak again. … And she’s lucky. She lived,” Bloomberg said.

The US Senate has opened debate on a proposal to expand criminal background checks on gun buyers.\nThe bipartisan move marks the most serious consideration of gun control legislation in 19 years, though many hurdles remain before final passage.\nMeanwhile, gun control advocates have gathered in Washington DC to make an emotional push for new restrictions.\nThe powerful gun lobby vows to oppose new gun control measures, arguing the US Constitution forbids them.\nThursday\'s procedural vote to begin debate passed 68-31, with a handful of Republicans joining all but two Democrats, who have the majority in the chamber.\nIt is the furthest into the legislative process any gun control bill has moved since 1994, when an assault weapons ban passed.\nBut where the debate goes from here is uncertain, says the BBC\'s Paul Adams in Washington.\nSenators could take weeks to thrash out all the likely amendments. And crucially, there\'s absolutely no guarantee that any of this will actually become law, our correspondent says.\n\'Far ahead\'\nGun control advocates planned several events on Thursday to draw attention to what is described as a national gun violence epidemic.\nReligious leaders from Newtown, Connecticut began a 24-hour vigil at 11:30 local time (16:30 GMT) on the National Mall near the White House and Capitol building.\nMore than 3,300 grave markers placed there will represent those killed by guns since a gunman killed 26 people at a primary school in Newtown in December.\nAnother group has been reading aloud the names, places and ages of these gun violence victims.\nThe lobbying push by both gun control and gun rights groups comes as a Democratic and a Republican senator have announced an agreement on a bill to expand background checks.\nOn Wednesday, Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania unveiled a deal that would expand criminal background checks to online and gun show sales, establish a commission on mass violence, and ease some restrictions on transporting guns across state lines.\nTheir proposal is being hailed as the best chance for new gun control legislation, though it falls short of the far stricter measures backed by the White House.\nCurrently, so-called private gun sales by dealers who are not licensed, including some at gun shows, are not subject to criminal background checks on the purchaser.\nVice-President Joe Biden, a strong supporter of new gun control legislation, told MSNBC\'s Morning Joe programme on Thursday that gun control was "one of the cases where the public is so far ahead of the elected officials".\nMr Biden also accused the nation\'s top gun rights lobbying group, the National Rifle Association (NRA), of spreading disinformation, and promised expanded background checks would not lead to a national gun registry.\nGun lobby warning\nWe don\'t have to agree on everything to know that we\'ve got to do something to stem the tide of gun violencePresident Barack Obama\nBut the NRA opposes the Manchin-Toomey deal, arguing background checks do nothing to prevent gun violence.\nIn a letter to senators on Wednesday, NRA lobbyist Chris Cox warned that the organisation would score lawmakers based on their votes on the Manchin-Toomey deal and other measures it opposes.\nPresident Barack Obama\'s other proposals, including a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, have not gained traction in Congress.\nAfter Thursday\'s vote, President Obama spoke to the families of Newtown victims, some of whom have become advocates for gun control, his spokesman said.\n"The president congratulated the families on this important step forward, noting that the bipartisan progress would not have been possible without their efforts," White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters.\nSenators will soon vote on a series of amendments to the legislation and then once more to close debate, before voting on the bill itself.\nProspects for legislation in the House are unclear, with Republican House Speaker John Boehner declining to say whether the lower chamber would hold a floor vote on the issue.\n"I\'ve made it clear that if the Senate passes a bill, the House will certainly review it," Mr Boehner told reporters on Thursday.\n"The thing that we have to remember is that laws are only as good as our citizens\' willingness to obey them. And law-abiding citizens, do, in fact, obey them. Criminals don\'t obey them. In addition to that, we\'ve got a system of laws that are not in force today."

Johnny Hanson / AP\nBarry Bailey and his wife Judy, of DeRidder, La., walk out hand-in-hand, after having their 1873 Winchester shotgun appraised at the NRA\'s Antiques Guns and Gold Showcase during the National Rifle Association\'s 142 Annual Meetings and Exhibits at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston. The 2013 NRA Annual Meetings and Exhibits runs from Friday through Sunday, with more than 70,000 people expected to attend.\nHOUSTON – A thousand miles couldn’t keep them away.\nBob Kittredge, 73, and his wife drove from Port St. Lucie, Fla., this week to attend the National Rifle Association’s annual convention. They are just two of the more than 70,000 people expected at the event, which opens Friday and runs through Sunday.\n“We meet a lot of people who think the same way we do,” Kittredge said.\nIt will be a nine-acre gun show in the middle of a national gun fight.\nAbout 550 exhibitors have packed the sprawling George R. Brown Convention Center in downtown Houston.\nIn the midst of a national fight over gun control laws, the National Rifle Association will hold its annual meeting in Houston this weekend, with Sarah Palin, Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal and more scheduled to speak.\n"NRA members vote and their friends vote,” said Drew Kelley, who said he’s been an NRA member for most of his life. “That is what\'s driving all this."\nKelley works for ProMag Industries, a firearm magazine manufacturer in the Los Angeles area that’s been in business for about 35 years and employs about 150 people.\nKelley said he values the Second Amendment – and that recent attempts at tighter gun control measures are misguided.\n“The whole idea was to keep people who should not have guns from acquiring them,” he said. “But the people who they\'re talking about don\'t go through the normal commercial processes anyway.”\n\'Stand and Fight\'\nAfter the mass shootings in Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., the NRA’s opponents seemed to have momentum. But two weeks ago, a bipartisan compromise on expanded background checks for commercial gun sales was shot down in the Senate.\n“We don\'t mistake battles for wars,” outgoing NRA president David Keene told NBC News. “It was a victory in a battle, but the war continues.”\nKeene’s two-year term concludes at the convention. Starting Monday, Keene will be replaced as president by Alabama attorney Jim Porter, although Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre will continue to be the organization’s main spokesman.\nIn his letter to convention attendees, LaPierre writes: “For months, our enemies have laid siege to the rights we cherish…But we are proving to be stronger than ever.”\nThis year’s convention slogan: “Stand and Fight.”\n“My concern as an NRA member is that any legislation needs to be targeted towards criminals and not law-abiding people,” said Bill Dermody, who works for Savage Arms, the Massachusetts-based firearm manufacturer that is one of the largest in the country and one of the convention’s 550 exhibitors.\nOn Friday afternoon, scheduled speakers include Sarah Palin, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum.\nThe opposition\nOutside the convention hall, several gun control advocates are planning to protest. At least one relative of a Newtown victim will attend. Another group plans to set up across the street and read 4,000 names of victims of gun violence.\nThe NRA’s opponents are launching a coordinated effort ahead of the 2014 midterm elections. The groups claim they finally have the financial clout to challenge the NRA thanks to Super PACs backed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.\n"We\'re simply losing too many loved ones to this epidemic and it\'s time for change," said Ladd Everitt, the spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. “And if people won\'t do the right thing, then we are going to work tirelessly to make sure their political careers come to an end.”\nGun control advocates argue that the NRA’s leadership cares more about the gun industry – and profit – than the rights of gun owners.\n“I think the NRA leadership is wildly out of step with their own members on the issue of expanding background checks,” Everitt sai

Two US senators have brokered a bipartisan deal to expand background checks on gun buyers, boosting White House hopes for a firearms control law.\nSenator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, and Senator Pat Toomey, a Republican, unveiled their plans in Washington DC.\nThe proposal would expand criminal background checks for buyers to include gun shows and online sales.\nPresident Barack Obama has been calling for gun controls since a massacre at a school in Connecticut in December.\n"Today is just the start of a healthy debate that must end with the Senate and House hopefully passing these common sense measures and the president signing them into law," Sen Manchin told reporters on Wednesday.\n\'Not a cure-all\'\nHe said Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid had assured them their plan would be considered as the first amendment to a wider bill.\nOn Thursday, the Senate plans to vote on whether to begin debate on Democratic-led legislation that would expand background checks to virtually all gun sales, make gun-trafficking a felony, and boost funding for school safety.\nThe Manchin-Toomey plan is stricter than the current law, which requires checks only when guns are bought through a licensed dealer and thus exempts private sales, many sales at gun shows, and some online sales. But it is viewed as narrower than congressional Democrats\' proposals.\nSales among friends or family members would be exempt from the background-check requirement, under the two senators\' proposal.\nSen Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said he did not believe expanding background checks to block illegal buyers amounted to gun control.\n"[Checks] are not a cure-all, but they can be helpful," the senator said, adding that 1.8 million firearms sales have been blocked by the current system.\nThe plan has also won the backing of New York Democratic Senator Charles Schumer, who attempted to broker an earlier compromise, and of a group lobbying for stricter gun controls founded by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n"Our bipartisan coalition of more than 900 mayors strongly supports this bill," Mr Bloomberg, an independent, said in a statement.\nMichelle Obama in Chicago\nAlso in the agreement is a plan to establish a federal commission on mass violence that would seek the expertise of those in the fields of mental health, school safety, firearms and entertainment.\nThe Senate\'s Democratic leadership believes it now has enough Republican support to thwart a conservative attempt to stop the bill even being considered on the floor of the chamber.\nIn a statement, the National Rifle Association said that more background checks "will not prevent the next shooting, will not solve violent crime and will not keep our kids safe in schools".\nSen Manchin said he and Sen Toomey had been in touch with multiple groups during their discussions, including the NRA.\nAnd a White House spokesman confirmed that Mr Obama had called negotiators from both parties on Tuesday.\nThe White House will continue its campaign on Wednesday as First Lady Michelle Obama visits a Chicago high school where 29 current or former students have been shot in the past year.\nRelatives of those killed in the December school massacre at Newtown, Connecticut, lobbied lawmakers on Tuesday. The family members were whisked to Washington by Mr Obama aboard Air Force One.\n"People should listen to what we have to say and move the debate forward," said Mark Barden, who lost his seven-year-old son, Daniel at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n"It\'s not just about our tragedy. Lots of kids are killed every day in this nation. We have to help lead the change."\nWhite House calls for a ban on assault weapons and a limit on the capacity of ammunition magazines have not gained traction in Congress.

If the White House gun violence policy announced today had been in effect, would it have changed the outcome of recent mass shootings?\nIt\'s impossible to say for certain, but here\'s a look at what it might have meant.\nNEWTOWN -- A tough assault weapons ban might have blocked the sale of the Bushmaster XM-15 that Adam Lanza\'s mother bought legally and which police say he used to kill all his victims in the school. A ban on high-capacity magazines might also have reduced the killing power of the weapons he brought to the school.\nPresident Barack Obama signs executive orders on gun violence during an event at the White House in Washington, January 16, 2013.\nAURORA -- As with Newtown, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines might have reduced the killing power that James Holmes brought into the movie theater.\nTUCSON -- Federal law bars gun sales to anyone who "is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance." When Jared Loughner attempted to enlist in the Army, he admitted he was a drug user. That information was never reported to the FBI for inclusion in the background check database, because a Justice Department policy dating from the Clinton administration directed federal agencies not to report information volunteered by drug users, for fear that it would deter drug users from seeking treatment.\nWe are waiting to hear from the administration on whether President Obama\'s executive actions announced today will rescind that Clinton-era policy.\nVIRGINIA TECH -- The dealers who sold Seung Hui Cho the guns he used in the Virginia Tech shooting followed the law to the letter, because there was no information in the system indicating that he was not qualified to buy a firearm. Federal law bans gun sales to anyone found by a court to be a danger to himself or others because of mental illness, but under the law then in effect in Virginia, the state entered people like Cho into the gun check computers only if they\'d actually been admitted as patients to a hospital. Virginia has since eliminated that loophole to bring its practices in line with federal law.\nAs for requiring universal background checks, two examples come to mind:\nCOLUMBINE -- Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were both under age 18, the minimum age under federal law to buy a rifle or shotgun from a licensed gun dealer. They recruited an 18-year-old Columbine High School senior to help them buy several guns used in the killings. The three went to a gun show in Adams County, Colorado and bought a semiautomatic assault rifle and two shotguns with cash. Klebold and Harris also bought an assault pistol from a private seller who had bought it at the gun show. These were the four weapons used in the Columbine attack.\nL.A. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- In 1999, Buford Furrow, a white supremacist, shot and killed a letter carrier then entered the LA Jewish Community center and shot five other people, including three children. He bought the gun, without a background check, at a gun show in Washington state. As a convicted felon, he could not have passed a federal background check.\nPopular Discussio

Chris Christie, R-N.J., says the shooting at the Garden State Plaza mall illustrates the need for stronger mental health treatment.\nGov. Chris Christie said Tuesday that the shooting at a popular New Jersey mall, carried out by a young man who “came there to end his own life,” demonstrates the need to strengthen mental health treatment.\nThe gunman, identified by authorities as Richard Shoop, 20, fired six shots at the mall before taking his own life. Authorities found his body after 3 a.m. Tuesday at a section of the mall under construction.\nNo one else was injured — the six rounds hit an elevator, an escalator and several storefronts — but the governor stressed to reporters that the outcome could have been much worse.\nAuthorities say they found the body of the suspected gunman who fired at least six shots inside New Jersey's Garden State Mall with a modified weapon resembling an AK 47 assault rifle. No other injuries were reported. NBC's Ron Allen reports.\n“Obviously that young man came there to end his own life,” he said. “We may not be that lucky next time.”\nChristie, up for re-election Tuesday, is a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2016. He spoke after casting his ballot, and chastised the Legislature for not having strengthened mental-health protections.\n“We need to get at these root causes,” he said. “And it is not the sexiest thing in the world to talk about, to be more aggressive in the mental health area. Everybody likes to brandish guns and put them on tables and say we’re gonna ban this or ban that.”\nHe added: “What we really need to get to is, every one of these incidents involved a deeply disturbed person who was not getting treatment. We need to get to that. If we get to that, we have a better chance of preventing some of these incidents.”\nChristie said that the gunman had left a note, “and I think came there to die from all indications.” Shoop’s brother, Kevin, told reporters Tuesday that his brother didn’t mean to hurt anyone, and that the shooting was an act of “self-indulgence.”\nThe gunman was wearing all black and a helmet when he walked the mall, Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J., one of the busiest in the United States, and began firing, authorities and witnesses said. Thousands of shoppers were in the mall, just before closing time Monday night, and hundreds of shoppers were locked into stores during the chaos.\nOfficials wearing tactical gear walk outside of Garden State Plaza Mall following reports of a shooter at the Paramus, N.J., mall.\nClarice Forbes, who works at a Talbots store, told NBC New York that she spotted the gunman and that he appeared to fire a rifle into the air.\n“When we walked past our store, he looked directly in the store and strolled past. It was very, very terrifying,” she said. “There were so many thoughts going through my head. I was so scared.”\nChief Kenneth Ehrenberg of the Paramus police said that Shoop had stolen the weapon, a gun modified to look like an AK-47, from his brother. He used it to kill himself, said John Molinelli, the Bergen County prosecutor.\nMolinelli said that Shoop had a drug history, but that there was no early indication why he carried out the shooting.\nLaw enforcement officers worked into the night to search the mall and get everyone out of the stores. The mall, which has more than 200 stores and 50 restaurants, will be closed Tuesday.\nA senior law enforcement official told CNBC that the law enforcement response was “textbook,” including SWAT teams and police. Authorities do not know whether the weapon was concealed, the official said.\nAbout 20 million shoppers visit the mall every year, according to its owner, Westfield Group.

Charles Krupa / AP\nPaul Regish of East Hartford, Conn., holds signs as gun rights advocates enter the legislative office building at the Capitol in Hartford, Conn., on April 3.\nConnecticut lawmakers passed a bipartisan package of gun laws that will expand the state’s existing assault weapons ban, impose limits on the size of magazines, and require universal background checks in the state scarred by one of the worst school shootings in American history.\nThe state\'s House voted 105-44 in favor of the bill early Thursday. Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has said that he will sign the legislation into law.\nState Sen. John McKinney, a Republican who represents the district where the Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre took place, said the bill was far from perfect but a necessary step to ensure the safety of the citizens of the state.\nMoments before the state\'s Senate bill passed by a vote of 26-10 on Wednesday, McKinney praised the state legislature for coming together in a bispartisan way, a model, he said, for the rest of the country.\n"The message we can send if those outside the walls of Connecticut are listening is encourage them to do the same, encourage our elected officials in Washington to put aside the politics and see if they can find some common ground," he said.\nSenate President Pro Tempore Donald Williams, a Democrat, opened the debate with a remembrance of the victims of the Dec. 14 Sandy Hook shooting.\n“All at once there was a report that as many as 20 children had been killed,” Williams said. “For a few seconds it was hard to breathe. I looked around at my colleagues as we recoiled at the horror of what we were learning.”\nAdam Lanza fired off 154 bullets in less than five minutes after entering the school in Newtown with a Bushmaster .223 rifle and several 30-round magazines, investigators have said.\nLegislators in Connecticut worked to achieve a bipartisan consensus on the gun-control package. Sen. Majority Leader Martin Looney, a Democrat, told NBC News in March that he hoped for a “broadly supported bipartisan bill,” but said it was “more important that we have a strong bill that meets the need.”\nThe package put together in Connecticut should serve as an example for national lawmakers, Williams said on Monday.\n“There were some who said the ‘Connecticut effect’ would wear off – that it would wear off in Connecticut and it would wear off across the country,” Williams said. “What they didn’t know was that Democrats and Republicans would come together and work to put together the strongest and most comprehensive bill in the United States to fight gun violence, to strengthen the security at our schools, and to provide the mental health services that are necessary.”\nMalloy called the package “the toughest law passed anywhere in the country.”\nSupporters of stricter gun controls applauded the bill even before it went to a vote.\n“I am grateful that the Governor and Connecticut Legislature took a bipartisan path to a strong gun responsibility bill,” Nicole Hockley, whose son Dylan was killed in the Newtown shooting, said in a statement. “I particularly appreciate that the Legislature listened to us and strengthened the provision on large capacity magazine size. “\nSandy Hook Promise thanked the governor and legislators for “passing the strongest gun responsibility legislation in the nation.”\nDozens of protesters who oppose new gun laws were gathered at the Capitol building in Hartford on Wednesday.\n“I’m prepared to contribute maybe to a class-action lawsuit, follow this up through the legal system,” gun owner Joe Winslow told NBC Connecticut.\n“I want legislators to pass laws that will protect people while not violating the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens,” said Joel Klusek, another anti-gun control protester.\nA post on the blog of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, a group that opposes gun control, said that buses would transport protesters from the parking lot of a Cabela’s sporting goods store in East Hartford to the Capitol and back on Wednesday.\n“Please help us fill buses to the Capitol in Hartford as we assemble in the gallery above the floor where critical votes will take place,” the post read. “This is a last stand to show our legislators that we will not go away and accept the proposal as our fate.”\n“CCDL wishes to thank the NRA for running these buses throughout the day!” the post said.\nThe state Senate passed the bill just moments after President Barack Obama finished a rally in Denver where he continued his push for Congress to pass a bill requiring background checks for every gun owner.\nNext week, the president will travel to Hartford to continue his call for stricter gun control laws as the Senate prepares to take up the bill.\nRelated:\nThis story was originally published on Wed Apr 3, 2013 2:36 PM E

The second Boston bombing suspect is in custody. Now everyone will focus on what it all means, what "lesson" we can learn from the events.\nMartin Richard was one of three innocent bystanders to die on Patriot\'s Day. As we debate issues of life and death in our state legislatures and Congress, we need to keep the picture of this boy and his sign not in our memories or Facebook walls, but on display.\nThe worldwide response to that picture -- which his teacher, Rachel Moo, said was made as part of a school lesson on the shooting of Trayvon Martin -- has been both heart-stirring and heartbreaking. People are striving to remember and to honor, yes; even more, though, they are trying to make his words real.\nEveryone killed in the Boston bombing, and during the events that flowed from it, was under 30. Martin Richard was 8 years old; how will his classmates handle their grief?\nKrystle Campbell, age 29, had moved to live with and help care for her ailing grandmother. Doctors had told Krystle\'s mother she had survived the blast, but they had mistaken Krystle\'s friend for Krystle. What must her mother and grandmother feel?\nLingzi Lu was a 23-year-old graduate student, the only child of her parents in China, who said learning of her death was "a dagger in our hearts." Sean Collier, 26, was shot multiple times while in his cruiser without drawing his gun. He had been a campus policeman with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for only a little over a year, and volunteered at the gym where one suspect trained as a boxer.\nThree days after the bombing of the Boston Marathon, the U.S. Senate defeated a bipartisan proposal aimed at curbing gun violence; it would have required more widespread background checks for gun purchasers, something 90% of Americans want. As a result of the bombing, immigration reform may soon become another political pingpong ball in the dysfunctional Senate.\nThe injured: Martin\'s father and older brother, Henry, escaped injury. His 6-year-old sister, Jane, lost a leg. Martin\'s mother, Denise Richard, 43, had brain surgery for a serious injury. The father, Bill Richard, 42, returned home briefly from the hospital to get clothing, and a neighbor said he was pale, almost dazed, and too grief-stricken to talk.\nThe sidewalk in front of their house is still covered with colored chalk drawings of butterflies, flowers, and stars that Richard and his sister had drawn before leaving for the marathon.\nJack Hart, a former state senator, told the Boston Globe that the Richards are "pillars of the community ... a model family, who somehow always found the time to give something back."\n"Any tragedy of this sort is extraordinarily difficult, but when you know people, when it\'s people in your life, in your school, that\'s when it really hits home,"\nThe Boston Globe quoted a classmate of Martin\'s, Colin Baker, 9, who said about Martin: "If somebody was left out, he would come say, \'Want to join my group?\' He sticks up for kids."\nAs I read and hear these responses, I keep thinking, what are we -- the adults -- what are we telling the children? Do we think they don\'t see the hollowness behind our hallowed words? Do we think they don\'t know the difference between courage and cowardice?\nThere\'s a cliché: "Perfect is the enemy of the good." Apparently, legislation must be perfect, because even after this horror, we are still finding ways to divide people. Should suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev be treated as an enemy combatant? Did the intelligence community pay little heed to the warning it received? Questions. Questions.\nBut let us pause to bury our dead and stand by the wounded as their struggle with the new reality of their lives. Some will have to learn how to simply stand up again -- wounded forever.\nWe should hold Martin\'s sign in our hearts and resolve to do better. Because, with President Barack Obama, "I\'m assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words."\nI, too, believe that, "sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of those who died and many who are still suffering demand it."

Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday downplayed the importance of passing an assault weapons ban, even as Senate Democrats began a formal push to revive restrictions on those firearms.\n"I\'m much less concerned quite frankly about what you call an assault weapon than I am about magazines and the number of rounds that can be held in a magazine," said Biden, who discussed gun violence during a Google hangout Thursday afternoon.\nWith the chat, the vice president looked to sustain public pressure for national action on gun control in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., massacre of 20 elementary school children and 6 adults. President Barack Obama is pushing a comprehensive set of actions to reduce gun violence, including universal background checks for gun buyers, a ban on high-capacity magazines, and a ban on actual assault weapons.\nSen. Dianne Feinstein proposes new federal ban on some assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons, as well as ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.\nIn the wake of Newtown, a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 56 percent of Americans believe gun laws should be more strict. The survey showed just 7 percent believe gun restrictions should be less strict.\nStill, Biden\'s comments and careful language -- "I don\'t view it as gun control, I view it as gun safety," he said -- underscored the political reality: Getting an outright ban through a divided Congress in the face of opposition from the National Rifle Association and other groups is unlikely, and the fight is likely to focus on other measures, like the background checks and limits on magazine size.\nBiden\'s comments came hours after Senate Democrats, led by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, displayed various assault weapons at a Capitol Hill press conference. Feinstein introduced legislation Thursday to ban 158 specific types of those guns.\nThe bill would also ban magazines that can fire more than 10 rounds of ammunition at a time. Both are similar to proposals included in the White House recommendations.\nShooting victims and uniformed police officers were on Capitol Hill Thursday to endorse Feinstein\'s bill.\n"If the slaughter of 20 babies does not capture and hold your attention, then I give up. Because I don\'t know what else will," said Charles Ramsey, the Philadelphia police commissioner and head of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. "We have to pass legislation."\nBut Feinstein herself openly acknowledged that getting Congress to pass a weapons ban similar to the one that expired in 2004 will be difficult, if not impossible.\n"Getting this bill signed into law will be an uphill battle, and I recognize that -- but it is a battle worth having,\'\' Feinstein said.\nBiden pointed out Thursday that crimes with assault weapons aren\'t as widespread than gun violence perpetrated with other types of guns that have been equipped to fire dozens of rounds at a time.\nAssault weapons "account for a small percentage of the gun crimes in American," said Biden, who led the White House task force on gun safety after Newtown.\n"More people out there get shot with a Glock that has … cartridges that you can have magazines that can put two, 10, 8, 12, 15, 30 shells in it, then from any assault weapon you see,” Biden said.\nHe said that limiting magazines could have saved lives in Tucson, where former Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot and a 9-year-old girl was killed, and in Newtown, where shooter Adam Lanza might have had to stop 10 or more times to reload his gun.\nThe vice president did say that banning assault weapons would help make people safer.\nThe NRA dismissed Feinstein\'s bill, insisting gun bans "do not work."\n"We are confident Congress will reject Sen. Feinstein\'s wrong-headed approach," the group said in a statement.\nPopular Discussio

MILFORD, Conn., July 8 (Reuters) - A national trade association for the firearms industry filed a lawsuit against Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy and others on Monday, seeking to reverse a tough gun-control law passed in the wake of the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nThe National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), which is headquartered in Newtown, Connecticut, just three miles from the school where a gunman in December killed 26 first-graders and staff, filed the lawsuit in federal court in Connecticut.\nThe shooting revived a national debate on gun control and resulted in some of the most stringent gun-control laws in the country in northeastern states like Connecticut and New York. Other states doubled down on their opposition to new curbs on gun ownership.\nMalloy signed one of the nation’s strictest gun-control bills into law on April 4, the day after it was approved by both the state Senate and House of Representatives. The law bans the sale of more than 100 types of military-style rifles, penalizes gun owners who don’t register with the state police by Jan. 1, and limits large-capacity magazines to 10 bullets.\nIn the lawsuit, the NSSF accused Malloy and Connecticut lawmakers of abusing their power to quickly push through legislation and said the law should be declared invalid. Gun advocates are seeking an injunction to stop its enforcement.\n“This is an action to vindicate the rights of the citizens of Connecticut whose federal and state constitutional rights have been adversely affected and significantly restricted by the passage of (the bill) through an abuse of the ‘emergency certification’ procedure, circumvention of the normal legislative process, and violation of Connecticut statutory law,” the lawsuit states.\nThe new law violates NSSF members’ rights to bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 15 of the Connecticut Constitution, the lawsuit said.\nThe NSSF includes about 9,500 members, including firearms manufacturers, distributors, retailers, shooting ranges, and sportsmen’s clubs. Several gun manufacturers are based on Connecticut.\nState officials said they are confident the law will be upheld.\n“We’ve known for some time that groups opposed to the new gun violence-prevention law would be filing suit against it,” said Malloy’s spokesman Andrew Doba.\n“We believe the bill improves public safety, and we will work with the Attorney General’s office to defend it,” he said. “Let’s not forget that this has happened before. In prior instances where Connecticut has passed common sense restrictions on firearms, there have been challenges. They have all been unsuccessful.”\nIn addition to Malloy, the lawsuit names J. Brendan Sharkey, speaker of the House, Donald Williams Jr., president pro tempore of the Senate, and State Attorney General George Jepsen. (Editing by Edith Honan; Editing by Philip Barbara)

Americans For Responsible Solutions, the gun-control group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly, is airing TV ads in Arizona and Iowa to persuade Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to back universal background checks.\n"We have a problem -- where we shop, where we pray, where our children go to school," Giffords says to the camera in one of the ads. "But there are solutions we can agree on, even gun owners like us." The screen then says: "Tell Senator Grassley to support background checks."\nGrassley is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that\'s considering all the gun-control legislation, and Flake also is a member of the committee. (Flake also represents the state, Arizona, where Giffords once served as a congresswoman before she was shot by a gunman.)\nThe ads -- a combined six-figure ad buy through this week and next -- are almost carbon copies of the advertisements Americans For Responsible Solutions aired last mont

Only a crazed militia type could possibly believe that, right? Except that — go figure — 65% of Americans see gun rights as a protection against tyranny. And only 17% say they disagree. Once again, it\'s the critics who appear to be out of the mainstream.\nOutside the mainstream\nAnd by out of the mainstream, I mean really out of the mainstream. According to a post-Sandy Hook Gallup poll, the NRA,with a 54% favorable rating, is actually more popular than President Obama. By contrast, Obama\'s most recent approval rating from Gallup was 48%. This is particularly striking given that the NRA has faced unrelentingly hostile treatment from most press and pundits, while President Obama has received treatment that is, to put it mildly, far more generous.\nEven left-Democrat Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota says he\'s unsure about whether he\'d support an assault weapon ban. This is, I presume, because he fears that even a blue state like Minnesota doesn\'t want more restrictive gun laws, and that a different position will hurt him in the coming election.\nIn other words, it seems likely that this Washington Post claim is right: That the NRA is actually winning.\nHow can that be? Simple enough. The NRA more closely reflects the views of most Americans on gun issues than do Democratic pundits — or Barack Obama.\nSomebody\'s out of the mainstream, all right. It\'s just not the gun-rights supporters.\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds is professor of law at the University of Tennessee. He blogs atInstaPundit.com.

The second Boston bombing suspect is in custody. Now everyone will focus on what it all means, what "lesson" we can learn from the events.\nThis is Martin Richard\'s lesson:\n"No more hurting people."\nMartin Richard was one of three innocent bystanders to die on Patriot\'s Day. As we debate issues of life and death in our state legislatures and Congress, we need to keep the picture of this boy and his sign not in our memories or Facebook walls, but on display.\nThe worldwide response to that picture -- which his teacher, Rachel Moo, said was made as part of a school lesson on the shooting of Trayvon Martin -- has been both heart-stirring and heartbreaking. People are striving to remember and to honor, yes; even more, though, they are trying to make his words real.\nEveryone killed in the Boston bombing, and during the events that flowed from it, was under 30. Martin Richard was 8 years old; how will his classmates handle their grief?\nKrystle Campbell, age 29, had moved to live with and help care for her ailing grandmother. Doctors had told Krystle\'s mother she had survived the blast, but they had mistaken Krystle\'s friend for Krystle. What must her mother and grandmother feel?\nLingzi Lu was a 23-year-old graduate student, the only child of her parents in China, who said learning of her death was "a dagger in our hearts." Sean Collier, 26, was shot multiple times while in his cruiser without drawing his gun. He had been a campus policeman with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for only a little over a year, and volunteered at the gym where one suspect trained as a boxer.\nThree days after the bombing of the Boston Marathon, the U.S. Senate defeated a bipartisan proposal aimed at curbing gun violence; it would have required more widespread background checks for gun purchasers, something 90% of Americans want. As a result of the bombing, immigration reform may soon become another political pingpong ball in the dysfunctional Senate.\nEvery pundit and every politician feels every bit of bombast is justified.\nAnd the children? Pictures and comments, memorials on Facebook. That\'s all.\n"No more hurting people. Peace."\nThe injured: Martin\'s father and older brother, Henry, escaped injury. His 6-year-old sister, Jane, lost a leg. Martin\'s mother, Denise Richard, 43, had brain surgery for a serious injury. The father, Bill Richard, 42, returned home briefly from the hospital to get clothing, and a neighbor said he was pale, almost dazed, and too grief-stricken to talk.\nThe sidewalk in front of their house is still covered with colored chalk drawings of butterflies, flowers, and stars that Richard and his sister had drawn before leaving for the marathon.\nJack Hart, a former state senator, told the Boston Globe that the Richards are "pillars of the community ... a model family, who somehow always found the time to give something back."\n"Any tragedy of this sort is extraordinarily difficult, but when you know people, when it\'s people in your life, in your school, that\'s when it really hits home,"\nThe Boston Globe quoted a classmate of Martin\'s, Colin Baker, 9, who said about Martin: "If somebody was left out, he would come say, \'Want to join my group?\' He sticks up for kids."\n"It should not have happened to him," Colin said to the Globe.\n"It should not have happened to nobody."\nAs I read and hear these responses, I keep thinking, what are we -- the adults -- what are we telling the children? Do we think they don\'t see the hollowness behind our hallowed words? Do we think they don\'t know the difference between courage and cowardice?\nThere\'s a cliché: "Perfect is the enemy of the good." Apparently, legislation must be perfect, because even after this horror, we are still finding ways to divide people. Should suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev be treated as an enemy combatant? Did the intelligence community pay little heed to the warning it received? Questions. Questions.\nBut let us pause to bury our dead and stand by the wounded as their struggle with the new reality of their lives. Some will have to learn how to simply stand up again -- wounded forever.\nWe should hold Martin\'s sign in our hearts and resolve to do better. Because, with President Barack Obama, "I\'m assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words."\nI, too, believe that, "sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of those who died and many who are still suffering demand it."\n"No more hurting people. Peace."\nFollow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion\nJoin us on Facebook/CNNOpinion

Weld County, Colo., Sheriff John Cooke, left, with El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa, center right, and other sheriffs standing behind him, speaks during a news conference at which he announced that 54 Colorado sheriffs are filing a federal civil lawsuit against two gun control bills passed by the Colorado Legislature, in Denver, Friday, May 17 2013. (Photo: AP)\nIn the wake of the tragedy in Aurora, Colorado passed some of the strictest gun control measures in the country.\nBut in recent months, an overwhelming 55 of the state\'s 62 county sheriffs have joined a lawsuit aiming to block the measures.\n"These bills do absolutely nothing to make Colorado a safer place to live, to work, to play or to raise a family," Weld County Sheriff John Cooke explained at a recent press conference. "Instead these misguided, unconstitutional bills will have the opposite effect because they greatly restrict the right of decent, law-abiding citizens to defend themselves, their families and their homes."\nSheriff Terry Maketa of El Paso County is one of the opposing sheriffs, and he explained on TheBlaze TV Wednesday how the public was "duped" into supporting overly vague legislation banning high-capacity magazines and requiring background checks.\nMaketa says they believe the laws are unenforceable, but also violate the Second and Fourteenth Amendments.\nAfter explaining the tactics used to pass the bills that essentially "eliminated all public input," Maketa reiterated that it\'s clearly an "overreaching step" for politicians to claim law enforcement supports stricter gun control.\nWhen asked by Pat Gray whether he and other sheriffs are "getting flak" for standing against the stricter measures, Maketa replied that it\'s the "exact opposite."\n"I would say the communications I\'ve received are 99% in favor," he added.\n"I think Colorado is the epicenter of this battle, and 55 Colorado sheriffs have drawn a line in the sand and said \'We\'re not going to tolerate it,\' he concluded. "[The laws] are unenforceable...and we certainly are not going to compromise citizens\' rights [to claim] that we are."\nWatch Maketa\'s entire interview on TheBlaze TV, below:\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n-\nRelated:

The Connecticut Legislature is scheduled to vote Wednesday on what leaders of both parties call the most far-reaching gun-legislation package in the country. The bill is thorough and bipartisan. Swift approval would send a message to the entire country that, as John McKinney, the Republican State Senate minority leader, observed, some issues must rise above politics. Mr. McKinney represents Newtown, where, in December, a gunman armed with a Bushmaster XM-15 military-style rifle massacred 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nIf the bill becomes law, no firearm could be sold in Connecticut until the buyer passes a national criminal background check; private sales of rifles and shotguns will be regulated; the list of banned assault weapons will be expanded from 66 to more than 150; and the sale, purchase, transfer or importing of large-capacity magazines (more than 10 bullets) will be prohibited.\nBecause of pressure from the gun lobby, lawmakers refused to add a ban on current possession of these magazines. They also failed to include a provision requiring the annual registration of handguns, including proof that a gun is still with the original owner. Connecticut Against Gun Violence, an advocacy group, says that most of the state’s gun murders occur in the cities of Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport; of these, most are committed with handguns no longer with the original owners. But lawmakers chose not to push back against the gun lobby’s false claim that registration leads to confiscation.\nThe gun lobby’s basic position is that the package would not have prevented the Newtown massacre. But it might have, if one of its provisions had been law: current state law requires secure firearms storage in households with anyone under 16; the bill extends that to households where the gun owner knows that someone living there poses a risk of imminent injury to himself or others. By significantly limiting access to the most dangerous firearms and ammunition, the package will not only contribute to public safety in Connecticut but will provide a laudable example to Congress and other states of what can be achieved with a serious bipartisan effort.

I have been on hiatus for a month but this has gotten me so angry I have to write....\nThe NRA has once again stopped the most FUNDAMENTAL background check for owning an assault rifle---no doubt with many fence-sitting GOP senators hoping the front-page publicity of this awful terror attack will shield them from potential fallout.\nThe same day that the NRA\'s GOP minions decided that it was okay for a violent criminal to shoot me in the face, I discover that the Boston investigators are blocked from doing a thorough investigation because of the NRA and their allies.\nIdentification taggants are used to make it possible to trace explosive materials after detonation back to the source of the bomb. It is simple, cheap, and allows tracing to a point of sale. Law enforcement, the ATF, and others have pleaded for it. Clinton tried to make it mandatory after the OK City bombing. Current experts say it would have helped with the current investigation.\nWHO would POSSIBLY oppose this technology?\nThe same idiots who oppose a background check for a killing machine....\nOne avenue of investigation is already closed off to forensic officials working the Boston Marathon bombing case due to efforts dating back decades by the National Rifle Association and gun manufacturers.\nThe FBI said Tuesday that gunpowder, along with pieces of metal and ball bearings, were packed into at least one pressure cooker and another device to make the crude bombs that killed three people—including an 8-year-old boy—and wounded more than 170 more during the Boston Marathon Monday.\nBut a crucial piece of evidence called a taggant that could be used to trace the gunpowder used in the bombs to a buyer at a point of sale is not available to investigators.\n“If you had a good taggant this would be a good thing for this kind of crime. It could help identify the point of manufacturer, and chain of custody,” Bob Morhard, an explosives consultant and chief executive officer of Zukovich, Morhard & Wade, LLC., in Pennsylvania, who has traced explosives and detonators in use in the United States and Saudi Arabia, told MSNBC.com. “The problem is nobody wants to know what the material is.”\nExplosives manufacturers are required to place tracing elements known as identification taggants only in plastic explosives but not in gunpowder, thanks to lobbying efforts by the NRA and large gun manufacturing groups.\nThis is nothing new. The ATF has complained that the long-unsolved Unabomber case along with the WTC, Atlanta, and OK City bombing investigations could have been significantly helped with taggant technology. For pete\'s sake, this was an article back in the LA Times in 1995:\nTechnology to help investigators trace the origin of explosives after bombings such as the one in Oklahoma City was developed more than 15 years ago, but the National Rifle Assn. and others, citing safety concerns, have lobbied successfully over the years to block its implementation.\nThe article was written 18 years ago... so this technology is well over 30 years old. But the NRA blocks it each time. WHY? The NRA actually claims it affects the trajectory of bullets (utter BS), and amounts to a "de facto" form of gun registration (really?). Both wonderful reasons why teams of investigators have to add weeks to their investigation combing through a city street for clues when they could possibly have had a lead already.\nOBAMA NEEDS TO GET SERIOUS!\nHe should call for Harry Reid to introduce legislation TODAY to allow taggants in gun powder.\nLET the f*ing NRA fight it! Let the GOP Senators filibuster it!! GO on... I\'ll wait....\nTHEN introduce background checks. AGAIN! Then introduce allowing taggants... AGAIN!! Rinse. Repeat.\nAll the way to 2014!!!\nIt\'s time people know whose side the NRA is really on: the side of violent shooters and terrorists. It\'s the only way things will change.

NEW YORK—West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said Tuesday he\'s optimistic that a revised bipartisan bill to expand background checks for gun sales will pass the Senate.\n"We really need five votes," Manchin, a Democrat, said during an interview at the Atlantic\'s New York Ideas Festival. The original bill, which Manchin co-sponsored with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, failed in a 54-46 Senate vote last month.\nA new bill, Manchin said, is in the works. "Oh, it\'s coming back," he said.\nManchin said he needs to educate law-abiding gun owners who support the legislation but don\'t trust the government.\n"The big problem is that they\'re afraid that this is the first step because they\'ve seen overreach," he said.\nThe background check bill, Manchin said, not only protects Second Amendment rights, but expands them.\nOther detractors said the bill might infringe on gun transfers between family members. "It doesn\'t at all," Manchin said.\nThe Democratic senator also scoffed at talk of the "culture war" discussed at the National Rifle Association convention in Houston over the weekend as cage-rattling rhetoric.\n"What you saw was the division that\'s going on across the country," Manchin, a gun owner and member of the NRA, said. "I don\'t know why we can\'t sit and talk and work together as Americans."\nManchin said the school shootings in Newtown, Conn., affected his views.\n"If Newtown didn\'t change you, nothing will," Manchin said. "It made you think, \'Can we do something a little better?\'"\nTwenty-six people, including 20 children, were killed in the Dec. 14, 2012, shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nManchin added: "None of those families came to my office and asked to repeal the Second Amendment." They asked him to make it harder for people who are bent on killing to get guns.\n"That was a small ask," he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday signed into law one of the nation’s toughest gun-control measures and the first to be enacted since the mass shooting last month at an elementary school in neighboring Connecticut.\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo signs the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act at the Capitol in Albany, New York January 15, 2013. The bill was passed by both the Senate and Assembly during a news conference. REUTERS/Hans Pennink (UNITED STATES - Tags: SOCIETY POLITICS)\nThe bill passed the Democratic-led Assembly on Tuesday afternoon, a day after sprinting through the Republican-majority Senate. State lawmakers have been in session for just a matter of days.\nNew York’s legislation comes just a day before President Barack Obama is expected to propose a national assault weapons ban and improved background checks as part of a sweeping package of initiatives to curb gun violence in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre.\nTwenty 6- and 7-year-old schoolchildren and six educators were killed in the December 14 attack, when a man burst into their school in Newtown, about 70 miles northeast of New York City, and opened fire with a semi-automatic weapon.\nThe Sandy Hook shooting plunged the nation into grief and reignited the gun-control debate.\nCuomo acted swiftly following that attack and another 10 days later in Webster, New York, a suburb of Rochester, that claimed the lives of two volunteer firefighters. The new law mandates a life sentence without parole for anyone who murders a first responder, the so-called “Webster Provision.”\nWith some provisions due to take effect immediately, the legislation expands the state’s ban on assault weapons, puts limits on ammunition capacity and has new measures to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill.\n“People who are mentally ill should not have access to guns, that’s common sense,” Cuomo said at a signing ceremony in Albany. “That’s probably the hallmark of this bill, coming up with a system that allows for mental-health screens.”\nThe measure limits magazine capacity to no more than seven cartridges - the current limit is 10 cartridges - and requires a statewide re-registration of all handguns and grandfathered assault weapons.\n“Seven bullets in a gun, why? Because the high-capacity magazines that give you the capacity to kill a large number of human beings in a very short period of time is nonsensical to a civil society,” Cuomo said.\nPolice have said the gunman in Newtown, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, carried numerous high-capacity magazines and that he changed gun clips several times, allowing him to unleash at least 150 rounds in his 10-minute assault.\nGun rights advocates lashed out at Cuomo and New York’s law, decrying the speed at which the legislation moved through the statehouse.\n“The National Rifle Association and our New York members are outraged at the draconian gun control bill that was rushed through the process late Monday evening,” the NRA, the nation’s most powerful gun rights lobby group, said in a statement.\n“These gun control schemes have failed in the past and will have no impact on public safety and crime,” the NRA said.\nAlso on Tuesday in Danbury, Connecticut, not far from Newtown, gun control advocates gathered for a rally outside a Walmart store to demand Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the nation’s largest gun retailer, stop selling assault weapons.\nAmong those at the rally were Lori Haas, whose daughter was injured in the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech, and Pam Simon, who was wounded in the 2011 shooting in Tucson, Arizona, that also critically injured former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.\nThe killings in Newtown, a rural New England town of 27,000, shocked the country and prompted Obama to form a task force headed by Vice President Joe Biden to find ways to curb gun violence. Obama is scheduled to unveil the recommendations on Wednesday.\nObama has signaled he will ask Congress to ban military-style assault weapons, require stronger background checks for buyers and put tighter controls on high-capacity magazine clips.\nOpponents of the New York legislation argued it would not prevent an attack like Newtown from occurring in New York and also would not bring down the state’s homicide rate because so few murders are committed with rifles of any kind.\nAssemblyman Raymond Walter, a Republican from upstate New York, said New York’s violent crime statistics show the state has a murder rate of just four people per 100,000, but “rifles account for .03 of that.”\nWere comparable legislation in place in Connecticut, “it would not have stopped that horrible and tragic crime,” said Assemblyman Joseph Saladino, a Republican from Long Island.\nThe new legislation would also increase monitoring of high-volume ammunition purchases, in-person or over the Internet, and current owners of assault weapons would be required to register them, as is required with handguns.\nSlideshow (12 Images)\nThis week, officials in Maryland and Delaware also vowed to press for their own state legislation to tighten bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\nIncluded in the New York law is an exemption allowing gun permit holders to opt to have their identities kept private, a measure that comes after the White Plains, New York-based Journal News published the names of thousands of local license-holders.

Democrats enjoy a supermajority in the Illinois House of Representatives, holding 71 seats to the GOP’s 47. On Wednesday, the same day the US Senate voted down gun control legislation, powerful Democrat Speaker Michael Madigan tried to push a restrictive gun control measure through his chamber. The result was an open revolt by downstate Democrats, with almost half the Democrat caucus joining the GOP to kill the measure. The bill 31-76, a rare defeat for the legendary Madigan.

Well you can count out one local law-enforcement agent who\'s not buying the executive actions just signed at the White House or any potential new gun legislation to come. An Oregon sheriff is citing his constitutional duty in accusing politicians of "attempting to exploit the deaths of innocent victims" to enact new gun laws that he thinks would harm his law-abiding locals. Linn County Sheriff Tim Mueller has promised not to enforce any new gun laws enacted in the wake of the Newtown shootings, making him pretty much the gun-rights hero of a very big day for pro-gun America. The reason we\'re hearing so much from this obscure sheriff is that he sent a letter to Vice-President Joe Biden and shared it with multiple news outlets like the Associated Press. There are two main kernels from his complaint — the first implies that politicians are exploiting the Newtown massacre:\nAnd here\'s Mueller\'s promise not to enact what he deems "unconstitutional" new gun laws and "actions," such as the 23 President Obama just signed into law:\nSomewhere in an undisclosed location, the powerful people behind the National Rifle Association are smiling. Mueller\'s points aren\'t unlike Wayne LaPierre\'s and the NRA\'s talking points — that the 2nd Amendment is very important, that there are good guys with the guns, and that good guys need guns to protect themselves with bad guys with guns. And Mueller\'s comments bear a close resemblance to New York State Senator Greg Ball, who admonished the state\'s newly passed and very tough regulations on Tuesday. Ball said:\nI simply cannot support a bill that turns law abiding citizens into criminals by creating an entire new category of illegal firearms out of currently legal rifles and shotguns,” said Senator Greg Ball.\nAnd Sheriff Mueller is already lauded on social media, by gun rights advocate, and alongside the conservative press. He\'s a hit on Breitbart:\nBut despite his gun-rights fan base, Mueller\'s views don\'t represent all of America. An AP poll found that nearly "six in 10 Americans want stricter gun laws in the aftermath of last month’s deadly school shooting in Connecticut" and "84 percent of adults would like to see the establishment of a federal standard for background checks for people buying guns at gun shows, the poll showed."\nHere\'s Mueller\'s full letter:

KUTZTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Students on some of Pennsylvania\'s college campuses might be carrying more than books.\nAt least five Pennsylvania state-owned universities are now allowing guns on campus after the state\'s lawyers concluded that an outright ban on weapons was likely unconstitutional.\nKutztown, Shippensburg, Edinboro, Slippery Rock and Millersville universities have all quietly changed their policies over the past year to reflect the advice of lawyers in the governor\'s office and the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. Students in those schools are now allowed to have weapons on campus, though they are still generally banned from school buildings and athletic events.\nStudents with concealed-carry permits had questioned the constitutionality of blanket weapons bans at state-owned universities, prompting a legal review that found such bans were vulnerable to court challenge.\nPennsylvania is among 23 states that allow individual colleges or universities to decide if they\'ll ban concealed weapons on campus, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Twenty-two states ban concealed weapons and five — Colorado, Mississippi, Oregon, Utah and Wisconsin — allow firearms on public university campuses.\nKutztown changed its policy April 19, though it had largely escaped notice until Kutztown President F. Javier Cevallos emailed students, faculty and staff about it Thursday night.\nUnder the new policy, licensed gun owners are permitted to bring their weapons onto campus, but not into buildings or athletic events without permission from the university police chief. The chief will consider making an exception if there is a "compelling reason" related to personal safety, the policy says.\nKutztown is not endorsing weapons on campus, spokesman Matt Santos said Friday.\n"Our president does not believe that guns have a place on campus," he said. "We will do what we can to keep our campus free of weapons and have written the policy to keep it as strong as possible to keep weapons away from buildings and campus events. We believe we provide a very safe environment for students to learn and live."\nAlthough there has been no legal challenge mounted in Pennsylvania, the state\'s lawyers cautioned that "blanket firearms bans were vulnerable to constitutional challenge and exposed the universities" to legal claims, said Nils Hagen-Frederiksen, a spokesman for the governor\'s Office of General Counsel.\nAbout a year ago, the state system provided a model weapons policy for consideration by all 14 schools "that more narrowly tailored the firearms restriction, addressing both public safety and constitutional concerns," Hagen-Frederiksen said.\nPennsylvania\'s concealed-carry law is silent on the issue of guns on college campuses. Other state laws do prohibit firearms in K-12 schools and court facilities, but there is no statute banning firearms possession at state-owned universities.\nThus "an outright weapons ban on public college campuses may be a problem under Pennsylvania law," Michael Moreland, a vice dean and professor at Villanova University\'s law school, said via email.\nLast year, he noted, the Colorado Supreme Court struck down the University of Colorado\'s ban, ruling it violated the state\'s concealed-carry law.\nThe new university weapons policies seemed unlikely to turn Pennsylvania\'s campuses into armed camps. At Kutztown, gun owners are generally limited to wandering the campus with their firearms, locking them in their cars, or checking them in at the police department.\nStill, as word of the new policy spread across campus Friday, students debated whether it\'s a good idea to allow weapons.\n"It promotes violence. You have lethal weapons on campus in a place where we\'re supposed to get a higher education, not carry bullets and guns and be prepared to kill someone. It\'s bizarre to me," said James Alexander, 21, a political science major from Pottstown.\nBut another student raised the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre, in which a gunman killed 32 students before committing suicide, to argue in favor of a well-armed student body.\n"It could potentially have been stopped," said Tony Pavoncello, 20, a freshman from York. "If one or more students had been armed and had been there when he came in the door, you never know what might have happened. It might have changed something."\nPennsylvania\'s largest university, Penn State, bans all weapons from campus, though students who hunt or shoot recreationally are permitted to store them with police. Penn State receives a state appropriation each year but is not owned by the state. The University of Pittsburgh — likewise state-supported but not state-run — also prohibits weapons anywhere on campus.\n"Our feeling is that police, who are trained in handling firearms, shooting accuracy during stressful situations and in making quick decisions and judgments, should be the ones with weapons," Penn State spokeswoman Lisa Powers said via email Friday. "They are the experts."\nGun-rights advocates including Students for Concealed Carry — a group launched in the wake of Virginia Tech —maintain that an armed campus is a safer campus because police typically can\'t respond quickly enough to stop a mass shooter in the act.\nA campus police chiefs\' association, the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, takes an opposing view. Its board has declared that allowing guns on campus could "dramatically increase violence."\nAlthough Kutztown changed its rules just a few weeks ago, the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education appeared to be having second thoughts Friday, telling all 14 member schools to hold off on weapons policy changes until a task force on campus safety can weigh in.\n"Given the importance of this issue, the significance of this issue, we think it\'s a good idea to take a second look," state system spokesman Kenn Marshall said.\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

The Connecticut Post, via Joe. My. God.:\nA false fire alarm, 45-minute waits to get into the Capitol complex, even the heckling of a bereaved parent of a Newtown shooting victim marked Monday\'s day-long legislative hearing on gun control.\n"The Second Amendment!" was shouted by several gun enthusiasts in the meeting room as Neil Heslin, holding a photo of his 6-year-old son, Jesse Lewis, asked why Bushmaster assault-style weapons are allowed to be sold in the state.\nI\'m going to put "heckling the father of murdered six year old" right at the top of my updated list of signs that America can safely ignore you, or at least not give a single flying shit as to what supposed rights you think you have, but I do want to reiterate one point: For a sizable percentage of America\'s most aggressive gun fetishists (not "enthusiasts," please—there\'s a difference between shooting as a hobby and stockpiling guns as your own personal anti-government, anti-society religion) the ability to quickly murder a classroom or two of elementary school kids isn\'t a bug. It\'s a feature.\nThis would be the prime argument of all the loons citing incipient "tyranny" as the reason they deserve guns, and all possible guns at that. If you\'re claiming that you need your guns because you might need to murder members of the government (yes, that is what "fighting tyranny" comes down to, when you\'re doing it with stockpiled ammunition), then the ability to murder a large number of people quickly is a prime feature. These aren\'t people who mumble about needing high capacity, military style weaponry because today\'s modern deer really need 30 or so shots pumped into them before they\'ll stay down—they\'re perfectly blunt about saying they need it because someday, there\'s gonna be "tyranny," and if they themselves wake up one morning and decide that "tyranny" has come they need to be able to go to their closet, arm up, and start killing people who think otherwise. Often, for some reason that most of the rest of us can\'t even begin to parse, it\'s couched in crackpot religious terms, often citing "prophesies" and other Jesus-sounding stuff as the reason why potential mass murder is, well, just around the corner.\nThat someone can easily dispatch a roomful or two of elementary school children, or college students, or theater-goers, or restaurant-goers with these same weapons is not seen by these people as something that needs fixing—at all. Yes, it\'s sad that those particular people got murdered, but whether Americans have the God-given right to murder a large number of people quickly, and easily, if they feel the circumstances warrant it is something the tyranny fetishists will go to their graves, or your grave, or the local sheriff\'s grave believing in.\nThe other tricky part of this is that (of course) the people most obsessed with defending themselves against government "tyranny" are the people who see "tyranny" in absolutely everything. The United Nations is coming for them; Barack Obama is a crazy Marxist; bicycle paths are a sign of the devil. The most unhinged people among us are the people who have volunteered themselves as the judges, juries, and executioners of any American government figures they\'ve decided they don\'t like—and those are the people that a large segment of our no-gun-regulations-ever crowd are catering to. Why? You could suppose the NRA, as obvious example, is merely acting as passthru for the manufacturer\'s lobby, which makes a very sizable income off of crazy frightened people, or you could suppose them to be unironic believers in the tyranny theory of American proto-terrorists someday becoming American freedom fighters—but why does the we\'d like to maybe someday be able to kill members of the government theory get so much mainstream love from supposedly mainstream sources?\nIt seems rather obvious that we could take all the arguments as to why one might need a 30-round clip because of potential tyranny and just flush that entire population from legitimate discussion. If tyranny does come to America, your little closet stockpile is not going to do a damn bit of good against the Air Force, and basing all our public safety decisions around your own little delusion that it might, someday, is not a very good reason for our continued enabling of frequent, convenient mass murder. So that seems a good first step: If you\'re arguing that people need to be able to speedily murder other people because someday you and your little band of societal malcontents may want to murder the right people, the ones who really need murdering, all of the policymakers concerned with American public safety ought to write off your opinions on the matter from the outset. Then the rest of us can begin to have a discussion on guns in America that isn\'t objectively, you know, insane.

Amid fears that 3-D printers could produce plastic weapons that easily evade metal detectors, the House voted Tuesday to renew a ban on plastic and other non-metal guns.\nThe bill, which was approved by voice vote, is the rare piece of gun legislation that both parties seem capable of agreeing on. It was sponsored by Republican Rep. Howard Coble, of North Carolina, and Democratic Rep. Steve Israel, of New York.\nThe bill, which provides a 10-year extension of a ban that has been in place for 25 years, heads next to the Senate.\nThere is some partisan division, though, over how far Congress should go in regulating plastic guns.\nThe bill approved Tuesday would renew a 1988 measure that bans the manufacture, import or sale of any firearm that can\'t be picked up by a metal detector. The measure has taken on new urgency as some have figured out how to produce plastic weapons on emerging 3-D printer technology.\nThe bill would not necessarily ban someone from producing such a weapon -- but it would have to include a metal component.\nSome Democrats, though, want to go further and require the metal components to be a permanent part of the gun. Right now, the metal parts on such weapons can snap on and snap off.\nWhile the House approved the basic renewal Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he will seek fast approval of a measure renewing the ban and tightening the restrictions when the Democratic-run Senate returns from a two-week Thanksgiving break next Monday, the day before the ban expires. His office says the current bill leaves in place a "dangerous loophole."\nThe National Rifle Association, which helped defeat last spring\'s background check measure, has said nothing publicly about whether it supports extending the ban on undetectable firearms.\nBut congressional aides and lobbyists say the group supports the renewal but opposes efforts to tighten the curbs. A longer renewal would limit Democrats\' opportunities to use bills extending the ban to include other gun restrictions.\nIn a letter to lawmakers last month, the smaller National Shooting Sports Foundation -- representing the nation\'s gun-makers and retailers -- said it backs the extension but opposes added restrictions on undetectable guns.\n"We are always concerned that laws and regulations do not hamper the ability of our members to take advantage of technological advancements," the group wrote.\nThe conservative Gun Owners of America opposes the extension, saying such laws wouldn\'t stop criminals intent on printing weapons.\n"They\'ve just spent all year trying to effectively destroy the gun lobby," Mike Hammond, legislative counsel of the small group, said of Democrats. "So why in heaven\'s name, given this intransigence, should we give them this Christmas present?"\nThe ban was first enacted in 1988 under President Ronald Reagan, when today\'s computer and weapons technologies were in their early stages. It was renewed in 1998 and 2003.\nFast forward to 2013, a world where 3-D printers can spray repeated, thin layers of plastic or other materials to create objects from toys to automobile parts to medical devices. They are being used increasingly by companies, researchers and hobbyists, and the technology is constantly improving.\nThe use of 3-D printers to make guns received heightened attention in May when Cody Wilson, then a University of Texas law student, posted blueprints online for using the printers to make the Liberator pistol, which he says he designed.\nWilson, founder of Defense Distributed, a nonprofit that advocates the free distribution of information on 3-D printed weapons, was ordered by the State Department to take down the instructions after two days because of allegedly violating arms export controls, he said.\nAt that point, the plans had already been downloaded more than 100,000 times and they remain available on file-sharing websites, he said.\n"If you want to do this, it\'s plainly obvious there\'s no one standing between you, your computer and your 3-D printer. Anyone can make this gun," Wilson said Monday.\nEarlier this year, ATF tested two guns made from different plastics using Wilson\'s Liberator design. While one exploded when fired, the other shot eight rounds before ATF halted the test.\n"The undetectable firearm threat has become real," agency spokesman Timothy Graden said in an emailed statement.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Congress is about as likely to impose firecracker control after a man lobbed some at the White House on Monday as lawmakers are to tighten gun laws after the slaughter of 12 people at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., only a few hours earlier.\nThat’s the grim feeling among profoundly frustrated gun-control advocates and their Democratic allies on Capitol Hill. They say privately that if the Christmastime massacre of 20 schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., last year couldn’t spur action on modest steps to combat gun violence, what chance does the killing of a dozen adults have?\n"We don’t have the votes. I hope to get them, but we don’t have them now," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday when asked if the Senate would revisit a bill to tighten background checks after Monday\'s shootings. The Senate rejected a similar measure in April.\nThat measure failed by five votes — Reid switched his “yes” vote to “no” in a procedural move that permits him to bring the proposal up again. On Tuesday, Reid said that he might consider revisiting a separate, limited bill that would exclusively address mental health issues.\n“Anything we can do to focus attention on the senseless killings that take place,” Reid said. “That’s something we will look at.”\nOn Monday, the tone of frustration with Congress\' inaction on gun legislation came from the very top, as President Barack Obama deplored that “we are confronting yet another mass shooting.”\n“We\'re going to be investigating thoroughly what happened, as we do so many of these shootings, sadly, that have happened, and do everything that we can to try to prevent them,” he added.\nObama made no mention of another push in Congress — and White House press secretary Jay Carney added to the impression of congressional stalemate at his briefing not long afterward.\n“We will continue to work to take action to reduce gun violence in this country through executive action, and hopefully Congress will take action to reduce gun violence as well,” Carney told reporters.

Two Democratic lawmakers in Colorado, including the president of the state Senate, were recalled Tuesday in elections brought about by their support for tougher gun control laws.\nAccording to unofficial results, voters in Colorado Springs favored recalling state Sen. John Morse, the body\'s president, by 51 percent to 49 percent. With 100 percent of precincts reporting, state Sen. Angela Giron of Pueblo was defeated in her recall election, 56 percent to 44 percent.\nThe Colorado Republican Party called the vote results "a loud and clear message to out-of-touch Democrats across the nation" in a statement released late Tuesday. Colorado\'s Democratic governor, John Hickenlooper, said he was "disappointed by the outcome of the recall elections" before calling on state residents to "refocus again on what unites Coloradans -- creating jobs, educating our children, creating a healthier state -- and on finding ways to keep Colorado moving forward."\n"We as the Democratic Party will continue to fight," Morse told supporters in Colorado Springs as he conceded the race. Republican Bernie Herpin, a former Colorado Springs city councilman, will replace him. Giron will be replaced by Republican George Rivera, a former deputy police chief in Pueblo.\n"We will win in the end because we are on the right side," Giron said in her concession speech.\nThe votes marked the first time in Colorado history that a state lawmaker faced a recall effort and the biggest backlash in states that passed tougher gun-control laws following two mass shootings last year – at an Aurora, Colo., movie theater and a Newtown, Conn., elementary school.\nDemocratic-leaning Connecticut, Maryland, and New York also passed tougher gun laws without a recall effort making a state ballot.\nThe states’ effort came after President Obama’s unsuccessful attempt to get Congress to pass stricter federal laws – including tighter background checks and bans on assault weapons and high-capacity gun magazines.\nIn Colorado Springs, the majority of registered voters are Democrats, but many are conservative-leaning. 23 percent of them, in fact, signed the petition to recall Morse, according to The Denver Post.\nThe National Rifle Association and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg lined up on opposite sides of the recall effort, led by gun-rights advocates upset over the legislation and how the hearings were conducted.\nBoth state legislators voted for 15-round limits on ammunition magazines and for expanded background checks on private gun sales.\nThe legislation passed Colorado\'s Democrat-led legislature without any Republican support and was signed into law by Hickenlooper, who had initially rejected calls for stronger gun control laws.\nMorse, a former police chief in suburban Colorado Springs, said Colorado\'s gun laws were commonsense ideas to reduce fatalities in mass shootings. He was first elected to the Colorado Senate in 2006.\nReported contributions to Morse and Giron totaled about $3 million, dwarfing the reported amount raised by gun activists who petitioned for the recall, though some independent groups didn\'t have to report spending. Both the NRA and Bloomberg contributed more than $300,000 to the pro- and anti-recall campaigns.\nIn addition, dozens of elected county sheriffs have sued to block the gun laws.\nOne of the Morse recall organizers, Timothy Knight, said supporters are upset that lawmakers limited debate on the gun legislation and seemed more inclined to take cues from the White House than their constituents.\n"If the people had been listened to, these recalls wouldn\'t be happening," Knight said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

DALLAS (Reuters) - Criminals in Texas beware: if you threaten someone in their car or office, the citizens of this state where guns are ubiquitous have the right to shoot you dead.\nA woman fires a handgun with help from an instructor in a file photo. Texas Governor Rick Perry\'s office said on Tuesday that he had signed a new law that expands Texans\' existing right to use deadly force to defend themselves "without retreat" in their homes, cars and workplaces. REUTERS/Jeff Christensen\nGovernor Rick Perry’s office said on Tuesday that he had signed a new law that expands Texans’ existing right to use deadly force to defend themselves “without retreat” in their homes, cars and workplaces.\n“The right to defend oneself from an imminent act of harm should not only be clearly defined in Texas law, but is intuitive to human nature,” Perry said on his Web site.\nThe new law, which takes affect on September 1, extends an exception to a statute that required a person to retreat in the face of a criminal attack. The exception was in the case of an intruder unlawfully entering a person’s home.\nThe law extends a person’s right to stand their ground beyond the home to vehicles and workplaces, allowing the reasonable use of deadly force, the governor’s office said.\nThe reasonable use of lethal force will be allowed if an intruder is:\n- Committing certain violent crimes, such as murder or sexual assault, or is attempting to commit such crimes\n- Unlawfully trying to enter a protected place\n- Unlawfully trying to remove a person from a protected place.\nThe law also provides civil immunity for a person who lawfully slays an intruder or attacker in such situations.\nTexas joins several other states including Florida that have or are considering similar laws.\nSympathy for violent offenders and criminals in general runs low in Texas, underscored by its busy death row. The state leads the United States in executions with 388 since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976 by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nA conservative political outlook and widespread fondness for hunting also means Texans are a well-armed people capable of defending themselves with deadly force.\nIt is easy to acquire guns over the counter in Texas and lawful to carry a concealed handgun with a permit.

A district attorney and his wife were found shot dead in their Texas home on Saturday, a chilling crime that has become a murder mystery. NBC\'s Gabe Gutierrez reports.\nKaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were found shot to death inside their Forney home Saturday, nearly two months to the day after his top assistant was gunned down on his way to work earlier this year.\nKaufman County Sheriff\'s Department investigators confirmed the deaths to NBC 5 Saturday evening, but officials have had little else to say about the investigation since. Sources close to the investigation told NBC 5 Saturday evening that McLelland and his wife were found at about 4 p.m. that day by a concerned relative or friend who had gone to the house after being unable to reach the couple. Other sources told NBC 5 that the McLelland\'s front door had been forced open and that gunshots had been fired and that an assault rifle was used in the murders.\nOn Sunday afternoon, Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes spoke with the media, but offered little on the investigation thus far and wouldn\'t confirm details released by sources. Byrnes also wouldn\'t speculate on whether the murders are connected to the Jan. 31 slaying of Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse saying, "there is nothing to indicate that, for sure."\nWhile there remains no immediate, confirmed link between Saturday\'s murders and Hasse\'s murder, the similarities between the cases prompted county officials to conduct welfare checks on all employees in the district attorney\'s office Saturday. All were OK, though one former Kaufman County prosecutor was "in hiding" Saturday evening and said others were as well.\nMeanwhile, as a connection between the Hasse and McLelland murders is explored, investigators continue to search for possible connections between Hasse\'s murder, the slaying of Colorado prison official Tom Clements and the shooting of Montague County Sheriff\'s Deputy James Boyd that sparked a wild car chase that ended with the fatal shooting of Evan Ebel last week in Wise County.\nKaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland\nByrnes also refused to comment on whether security measures have been put in place for the staff of the district attorney\'s office other than to say they are taking precautions. Byrnes did say that there would be an increased and visible security presence at the Kaufman County Courthouse on Monday.\n"It\'s unnerving to the law enforcement community and the community at large. That\'s why we\'re striving to assure the community that we are still providing public safety and will be able to do that," Byrnes said, about the McLelland murders.\nA tip line has been set up for the investigation and anyone with information to share with investigators is asked to call 1-877-847-7522.\nMcLelland Vowed to Catch Hasse\'s Killer\nWhile police officers are frequently the target of violence while trying to apprehend criminals, attacks on prosecutors are extremely rare, though not unheard of. McLelland said as much in January when speaking about his slain friend when he said Hasse was aware of the dangers associated with being a prosecutor.\nAt the time, he described Hasse as a really, really good man that was an excellent friend and a spectacular prosecutor who wouldn\'t be easily replaced. He also vowed to catch Hasse\'s killers saying, "I hope that the people that did this are watching. Because we\'re very confident that we\'re going to find you, pull you out of whatever hole you\'re in, bring you back and let the people of Kaufman County prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law."\nFBI agents and Texas Rangers, who were still investigating the unsolved slaying of Hasse, are now leading the investigation into Saturday\'s murders, according to a federal law enforcement source.\nMcLelland and his wife, Cynthia Woodward McLelland, have five children including two daughters and three sons. One of the sons is a Dallas police officer.\nNBC 5\'s Ray Villeda and Scott Gordon contributed to this report.\nThis story was originally published on Sun Mar 31, 2013 3:22 PM EDT\nPopular Discussions

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate\'s top Democrat is setting Congress\' first showdown vote for Thursday on President Barack Obama\'s gun control drive as a small but mounting number of Republicans appear willing to buck a conservative effort to prevent debate from even beginning.\nMajority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada announced his decision Tuesday as the White House, congressional Democrats and relatives of the victims of December\'s mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., amped up pressure on GOP lawmakers to allow debate and votes on gun control proposals. Twenty first-graders and six educators were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School, turning gun control into a top-tier national issue.\n"We have a responsibility to safeguard these little kids," Reid said on the Senate floor, pointing to a poster-sized photo of a white picket fence that had slats bearing the names of the Newtown victims. "And unless we do something more than what\'s the law today, we have failed."\n"We don\'t have the guts to stand up and vote yes or no? We want to vote maybe? Tell that to the families in Newtown" and other communities where there have been mass shootings, said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.\nBut Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, one of 13 conservative senators who signed a letter promising to try blocking debate, said the Senate bill puts "burdens on law abiding citizens exercising a constitutional right." He said none of its provisions "would have done anything to prevent the horrible tragedy of Sandy Hook."\nObama was calling senators from both parties Tuesday to push for the gun bill, according to a White House official.\nReid\'s determination to stage a vote came despite inconclusive talks between Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., aimed at finding compromise on expanding background checks to more gun purchasers.\nBut Manchin left a meeting in Reid\'s office late Tuesday and said he hoped a deal could be completed on Wednesday. Such a compromise would be likely to attract bipartisan support because both lawmakers are among their parties\' most conservative members.

NEWTOWN, Conn. (AP) — Some residents of the Connecticut community devastated by December\'s school shooting said they\'re outraged over robocalls they\'ve received from the National Rifle Association only three months after a gunman killed 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nNewtown residents said the automated calls from the NRA began last week and urge people to tell their state legislators to oppose gun control proposals. Some also said they received postcards from the NRA supporting gun owners\' rights.\n"It\'s ridiculous and insensitive," Newtown resident Dan O\'Donnell told Hartford-area NBC affiliate WVIT-TV, one of several media organizations to report about the robocalls. "I can\'t believe an organization would be so focused on the rights of gun owners with no consideration for the losses this town suffered."\nA message seeking comment was left Monday at the NRA\'s headquarters in Fairfax, Va.\nLike Congress and other state legislatures, Connecticut\'s General Assembly has been considering gun control measures in the wake of the school shootings, including banning assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.\nThe NRA strongly opposes many gun control proposals including an assault weapons ban, saying government officials should better enforce existing gun laws and not impede on people\'s Second Amendment rights.\nWayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, has said his organization supports getting the records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent and dangerous into the background check system for gun dealers and beefed up penalties for illegal third-party purchases and gun trafficking.\nShortly after the Newtown shooting, LaPierre also called for armed security guards in schools.\nA 20-year-old gunman killed 26 students and educators and himself at Sandy Hook on Dec. 14, after having shot his mother to death at their Newtown home.\nAnother Newtown resident, Christopher Wenis, told The Huffington Post that he received three of the NRA\'s robocalls last week.\n"I\'ve got a 5-year-old son who went to preschool on the Sandy Hook Elementary School campus," Wenis said. "And this was a really hard week for me on a lot of levels. These calls were the very last thing I needed."

Wounded former Representative Gabrielle Giffords has implored Congress to curb gun violence, at the first hearing on the issue this year on Capitol Hill.\nThe Arizona Democrat, who was shot in the head in a 2011 attack that killed six people, said too many children were dying in shootings.\nBut the National Rifle Association told the Senate judiciary committee that gun control was not the answer.\nThe renewed gun-control drive follows last month\'s massacre in Connecticut.\nTwenty children and six adults were killed in the attack at a primary school in Newtown, which shocked a nation with the world\'s highest rate of gun ownership. Firearms sales in the US have risen since the shooting.\nMs Giffords, who is still recovering after being shot by a mentally ill gunman while meeting her constituents in Tucson, opened Wednesday\'s hearing saying: "Violence is a big problem.\n"Too many children are dying. Too many children. We must do something. It will be hard. But the time is now. You must act. Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you."\nHer husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, also testified.\nThe couple, both gun owners, recently launched a political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, intended to combat firearms violence.\nDuring the hearing, reports of another mass shooting emerged from Ms Giffords\' home state.\nPolice in Phoenix, Arizona, said three people had been shot - one killed and two others critically wounded - at an office complex. The gunman\'s whereabouts were unknown.\nNRA opposes checks\nWayne LaPierre, executive vice-president of the NRA, an influential firearms lobby group, told Wednesday\'s hearing that gun control measures had failed in the past.\nPresident Barack Obama this month proposed sweeping measures on guns, including a renewed ban on assault rifles and wider background checks on buyers.\nBut Mr LaPierre said the government\'s own figures had shown the last assault-weapons ban from 1994-2004 made no impact on lowering crime.\n"Law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals," said Mr LaPierre.\n"Nor do we believe that government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families."\nUnder questioning, Mr LaPierre conceded that his organisation no longer supported universal background checks for gun owners.\nThe Senate judiciary committee is divided on the White House plans, which face a rocky road in both the Democratic-led Senate and Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\nRepublican Senator Orrin Hatch said on Tuesday that he was "a strong supporter of the second amendment" - referring to a clause in the US Constitution on the right to bear arms.\n"And I don\'t intend to change," he added.\nAnother member, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, has already introduced a bill, similar to the White House plan, that would seek to ban assault weapons and limit ammunition magazines to less than 10 rounds.\nBut Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said he believed it would be possible to introduce wider background checks.\nThose buying guns from licensed stores and vendors are required to face a background check, but some purchasers buying guns from private sales at firearms shows and online do not need to do so, an exception often referred to as the gun-show loop-hole.\nPresident Obama has called for background checks in both instances, as well as increased reporting by states on those who are not allowed to buy a gun for legal or mental health reasons.\nThe hearing also took place on the day it emerged that a 15-year-old girl who performed at President Obama\'s inauguration last week had been shot dead in Chicago.\nHadiya Pendleton was attacked by a gunman who opened fire on her and friends as they sheltered from rain in a city park. Police suspect the attacker mistook the group for gang members.

Gun control. That\'s what it was called before Newtown. Remember how no one was talking about gun control?\nExcept for the NRA. They never stopped talking about it. This is from June 2012:\nPresident Barack Obama has shown little interest in peddling a gun control agenda during his first term, but the National Rifle Association is urging its members not to let its guard down ahead of the 2012 election.\nIn a new mailer, forwarded to us by a reader, the gun rights group lists "Ten Reasons Why Obama is Bad for the Second Amendment." We’ve been exploring several claims on the list this week -- you can see our findings here...\nThe NRA has taken a fragment of an unclear quote and prescribed the most far-reaching, conspiratorial conclusion. There simply isn\'t enough evidence for such a sweeping claim. We rate it Pants on Fire.\nFor an interesting reminder of how Newtown changed the President\'s priorities, check out this brief video from Bloomberg on Dec 19th, or this one, same date, with Chuck Todd, entitled Tipping Point:\nDavid Maraniss has more:\nIf Dec. 14, 2012, was, as he said, his most difficult day in the White House, one unspoken aspect of his despair was a sense of deep remorse that, in the service of political survival, in the pursuit of power, in the obsession with avoiding traps, he had given little more than perfunctory attention to the issue of gun control. In word and deed since then, he has shown more passion and resolve. Perhaps the conscience of his late mother kicked in, her idealism finally overtaking his concern that people like her were too naive. Certainly the empathy of a father with young daughters had a transformative effect.\nSo does Jodi Kantor:\nWhen the president returned from consoling families of teachers and children killed in the Newtown, Conn., massacre — he wept as they handed him photos and told him stories of victim after victim — aides could see in his face the toll of absorbing the nation’s traumas. “This is what I do,” Mr. Obama told them.\nBut it wasn\'t just the President. All over the country, from local forums to national platforms, everyone has been talking and debating about gun violence and what to do about it. From the Danbury News-Times:\nTop police commanders from several of the state\'s cities and towns have thrown their weight behind Newtown police Chief Michael Kehoe, who inserted himself firmly into the gun-control debate last week by calling for a ban on assault weapons.\nBecause it isn\'t just the NRA now, the discussion has been much more thoughtful and balanced than this guy:\nDAVID GREGORY: You don\'t think guns should be part of the conversation?\nWAYNE LAPIERRE: I think that is the one thing that we can do immediately that will immediately make our children safe.\nDAVID GREGORY: Is it the only thing?\nWAYNE LAPIERRE: Gun control, you could ban all Dianne Feinstein\'s, you could do whatever she wants to do with magazines, it\'s not going to make any kid safer. We\'ve got to get to the real problems, the real causes. And that\'s what the N.R.A. is trying to do.\nAnd I think, I\'ll tell you this, I have people all over the country calling me saying, "Wayne, I went to bed safer last night because I have a firearm. Don\'t let the media try to make this a gun issue."\nThe media didn\'t make it a gun issue. Shooting 20 first graders multiple times each—along with the brave adults who were shot trying to protect them from being massacred—made this a gun issue. Only a gun issue? No, not by any means. But a gun issue nonetheless? Despite LaPierre\'s tone-deaf response, yes.\nAnd has it mattered? Here\'s the headline from the Jan 18th NY Times, referring to their own poll:\nMassacre Sways Public in Way Others Did Not\nThe massacre of children at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., appears to be profoundly swaying Americans’ views on guns, galvanizing the broadest support for stricter gun laws in about a decade, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll.\nHere\'s an even broader view, looking specifically at the question (not all polls ask it) of making gun laws more strict:\nJoin us below the fold as we talk more about how Newtown changed the landscape.\nGallup captures changing public opinion:\nPoll after public opinion poll shows the same thing. This one is from AP (here is the .pdf):\nSome 58 percent favor strengthening gun laws in the United States. Just 5 percent felt such laws should be loosened, while 35 percent said they should be left unchanged.\nIn comparison, after the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007, an Associated Press-Ipsos poll found that 47 percent wanted stricter gun laws, 38 percent thought they should remain as is and 11 percent wanted to see them loosened.\nAnd this one is from Reuters (here are the topline results):\nAbout three-quarters of Americans surveyed support proposals to ban the sale of automatic weapons, ban high-capacity ammunition clips and expand background checks on all gun buyers, according to an online Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday.\nThose proposals were at the heart of President Barack Obama\'s package of recommendations to Congress on Wednesday designed to curb gun violence after last month\'s elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 20 children and six adults.\nSpeaking of the President\'s proposals, this Gallup poll actually looked at them.\nAmericans\' immediate reaction to President Barack Obama\'s proposals for new laws designed to reduce gun violence is more positive than negative, with 53% saying they would want their representative in Congress to vote for the set of proposed new laws, while 41% say their representative should vote against them.\nThe only sub-groups that oppose it are conservatives and Republicans. Duh. Hugely popular in the East (68-30), marginally popular out West (47-45). Midwest (50-42) and South (49-44) okay with it.\nMeanwhile and more broadly, the Republican response so far isn\'t encouraging. "Lie about what you really think" isn\'t a way to govern, it\'s a way to win elections. That\'s a distinction lost on many in the House, since they are not especially interested in governance. Then again, that\'s why their numbers are so bad. In this poll, the negative Republican number is at an all-time high. No, it\'s not the messaging. Yes, it\'s the policy content.\nUntil we see where they stand and where they actually vote on measures the President has suggested, I\'m skeptical that they have the courage and the guts to stand up to the NRA leadership and support what the public and NRA membership wants.\nBut, and these are vital points to consider:\n• The public supports specific parts of Obama\'s proposals and, in general, supports the concept of stricter gun laws.\n• In 2011, NRA members supported specific proposals like background checks, and in July 2012, the same was true. Wayne LaPierre does not speak for all of them (even though 70% of NRA members are conservatives). Link\n• After Newtown, 85% of NRA households support background checks. Link. (For the distinction between NRA households and members, see previous link - it\'s men vs women.)\n• The Republican party itself is extremely unpopular, limiting the leverage of opposing everything for the sake of opposition.\n• Obama is seen as a strong leader (61%, WaPo poll).\n• The intensity, for a change, is not entirely on the side of the NRA (link):\nWith those kinds of numbers, and a determined White House, don\'t assume anything about what happens next, even if the conventional wisdom is that nothing will pass Congress. It might be that, as speculated by many, the assault weapons ban gets traded for everything else (not a terrible outcome). Or it might be some other outcome entirely.\nBut understand that simply writing about the NRA\'s past successes is a lazy way to approach the issue.

President Barack Obama said Friday that children from communities wracked by poverty and violence need help from the government, schools, family and clergy to have a chance to climb "ladders of opportunity" to reach the middle class and beyond.\nSpeaking at a Chicago high school near where he used to live, Obama cited gun violence that killed 443 people in the city last year as one reason why children need community wide support to help them believe they can improve their lives through education and hard work.\n"In too many neighborhoods today, whether here in Chicago or the farthest reaches of rural America, it can feel like, for a lot of young people, the future only extends to the next street corner or the outskirts of town," he said, adding "that no matter how much you work or how hard you try, your destiny was determined the moment you were born."\nMaking his third campaign-style appearance in three days, Obama again emphasized proposals from Tuesday\'s State of the Union address, such as raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour and providing good pre-schooling for every child as necessary to help people better themselves.\nThe president also called for Congress to vote on a package of gun proposals aimed at decreasing shootings like ones that occur daily on streets and in homes, as well as mass killings in recent months at a school, a movie theater and even a place of worship.\nAccording to the Centers of Disease Control, there were 11,078 homicides by firearm in the United States in 2010, and 7,220 of the victims -- 65% -- were aged 15-34. In addition, 6,151 -- or 56% -- were African American, a demographic that comprises about 13% of the total U.S. population.\n"This is not just a gun issue," he continued. "It\'s also an issue of the kinds of communities that we\'re building, and for that we all share responsibility as citizens to fix it."\nIt all starts at home, the president said, calling "strong, stable families" and "loving, supportive parents" the most important ingredients for reducing violence.\nNoting he was raised by a single mother, he called for promoting marriage and encouraging fatherhood, saying he wished he had a father around and involved when he was a boy.\n"By the way, that\'s all kinds of parents," he added, drawing applause when he specified "it includes gay or straight parents."\nHe acknowledged the challenge, saying "it will not be easy, but it can be done."\n"No solution we offer will be perfect," he said. "But perfection has never been our goal. Our goal has been to try and make whatever difference we can."\nObama headed to his hometown after a White House ceremony Friday morning to award the Presidential Citizens Medal -- the nation\'s second-highest civilian honor -- to 18 people. They included posthumous honors for six educators killed along with 20 first-graders in December\'s Connecticut school massacre.\nThe president hugged family members of the slain teachers and administrators from Sandy Hook Elementary School in presenting the medals, saying: "We could not be more grateful to your loved ones, who gave everything they had" for the children in their care.\nIn his remarks later at Chicago\'s Hyde Park Academy High School, Obama mentioned Hadiya Pendleton, 15, who was killed by gunfire in the city last month after returning from taking part in inaugural activities in Washington.\nThe president said his package of gun measures was intended to save young lives and that "they deserve a vote," repeating the phrase a few times as he did in Tuesday\'s address at the Capitol.\nFierce opposition by the National Rifle Association makes passage of any significant gun legislation uncertain. In response to Obama\'s State of the Union address, the NRA has sought to discredit the motives and impacts of legislation proposed by the president and Democrats.\n"They only care about their decades-old gun control agenda — ban every gun they can, tax every gun sold and register every gun owner," NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre said in a statement on Thursday. "This president has taken the art of public deception and manipulation to a whole new level."\nObama seeks an updated version of the 1994 assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004, that would prevent the manufacture and sale of some semi-automatic rifles modeled after fully automatic assault weapons.\nHe also proposes limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, expanding background checks to all gun transactions, including sales at gun shows. In addition, the president wants Congress to take steps to better screen people with mental illnesses, so they cannot obtain weapons.\nLegislation proposed so far also would crack down on so-called straw purchases, in which a legal buyer purchases weapons for distribution to non-legal buyers.\nThe NRA and other opponents argue the Democratic proposals are veiled attempts to limit gun ownership and eventually take away weapons, and therefore violate the constitutional right to bear arms.\nIn particular, opponents contend the proposed ban on semi-automatic rifles focuses on a weapon used in a tiny percentage of killings and other gun violence.\nHarold Pollack, co-director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, confirmed on Friday that so-called assault weapons targeted by the proposed ban account for a small fraction of murders in the United States.\nHowever, Pollack said the ban proposed by Obama can help reduce gun violence, especially what he called the psychologically impactful mass shootings such as the Newtown attack in which a lone gunman used a Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle.\nThe combination of such weapons with high-capacity magazines "facilitates mass homicides," Pollack told CNN, noting that professional criminals generally don\'t use such rifles that look like military weapons.\n"The people who do use these weapons are often the most dangerous or most sociopathic," Pollack said. The Newtown shooter, a 20-year-old man living with his mother, took her legally owned guns and killed her before going to the school to open fire on students and teachers.\nTo Pollack, such a mass killing -- while relatively rare -- "traumatizes communities and the entire society in a way that demands attention."\nStudies show that street crime such as shooting deaths cost communities more than lives, Pollack said, citing emergency medical services and criminal investigation as tangible costs along with intangibles such as residents moving away to escape the threat.\nObama also made that point in his remarks on Friday, saying "it\'s very hard to develop economically if people don\'t feel safe."\nIn the aftermath of the Newtown shootings, the NRA called for putting armed guards at every school, rather than seeking to limit the ability of people to obtain weapons. It also wants tougher enforcement of existing gun laws, which Pollack agreed was necessary.\n"A lot of the underground gun market could be stopped if we treated guns with the same amount of determination and tools as the drug market," he said.\nFor example, Pollack noted how committing a crime with a gun brought additional charges, and he called for similar treatment for illegally possessing a firearm.\nIn a Google Hangout online chat on Thursday, a participant asked Obama how renewing the assault weapons ban would help reduce gun violence caused primarily by handguns.\nHe responded that his proposed package would affect handgun violence through the expanded background checks and cracking down on straw purchases. Renewing the weapons ban focused on what Obama called "weapons of war."\n"It\'s not going to solve every problem," the president continued, noting that some restrictions are already in place.\n"We can\'t purchase a grenade launcher from a store, although there may be some folks who want to buy those," he said. "And the reason is we think on balance, the Second Amendment does not automatically assume that any weapon that\'s available you can automatically purchase."

Police chiefs attending represent Newtown%2C Conn.%3B Aurora%2C Colo.%3B and Oak Creek%2C Wis.\nMeeting is part of the president%27s effort to build support for gun control plan\nPresident says his goal is to keep guns out of the wrong hands\nLobbying Congress to pass meaningful gun control, President Obama sought Monday to build public support through local law enforcement officials -- including police chiefs from cities that saw mass killings in 2012.\n"If law enforcement officials who are dealing with this stuff every single day can come to some basic consensus in terms of steps that we need to take, Congress is going to be paying attention to them," Obama said.\nThe president spoke as he and Vice President Biden met at the White House with the police chiefs of Newtown, Conn., Aurora, Colo., and Oak Creek, Wis.\nThe Dec. 14 shooting in Newtown killed 20 children and six adults at an elementary school, and prompted the new gun push by Obama and Biden.\nThe administration\'s proposal calls for a renewed assault weapons ban, universal background checks and restrictions of the sizes of ammunition magazines, as well as new school safety and mental health programs.\nAurora, Colo., is the city where 12 people died in a mass shooting at a movie theater in July; Oak Creek, Wis., is the site of the Sikh temple where six people died during a shooting in August.\nObama\'s plan also received an endorsement Monday from another group of local officials: The U.S. Conference of Mayors.\nPhiladelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, the current conference president, called for "a national commitment to reduce the culture of violence, stop the easy access to guns by those who should not legally possess them, and increase access to badly needed mental health services."\nSome of the police chiefs who met with Obama were Michael Kehoe of Newtown, Daniel Oates of Aurora and John Edwards of Oak Creek.\nThe meeting also featured police chiefs and sheriffs from Alabama, Arizona, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Utah.\nGun rights groups such as the National Rifle Association have vowed to block Obama\'s gun-control proposals, calling them ineffective violations of Second Amendment rights.\nObama said he realizes the gun issue "elicits a lot of passion," but the goal is to keep guns out of the wrong hands.\nWhile Obama has issued executive orders designed to bolster the existing background check system and promote research into the causes of violence, he said that "the only way that we\'re going to be able to do everything that needs to be done is with the cooperation of Congress."\nThe White House meeting also featured representatives from the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the Major County Sheriffs\' Association. Obama said it\'s important to listen to law enforcement officials at the local level because "they are where the rubber hits the road."\nAttorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Janet Napolitano also attended the meeting at the White House.

Incoming president says NRA growth is due to sense of outrage\nOrganization membership is at a record 5 million\nNRA vows to fight any compromise on gun-control legislation\nHOUSTON — The board of the National Rifle Association will elect as its president Monday a hard-line culture warrior who has worked for decades to make the NRA a more aggressive political force.\nThe election of James Porter — ensured after the endorsement of outgoing President David Keene last week — is one of many defiant signals to come out of the NRA\'s annual meeting in Houston over the weekend. The organization vowed to continue to fight any compromise on gun-control legislation in Congress.\n"Revenge is what\'s motivating the president\'s unrelenting attacks on gun owners today," Porter told the group\'s meeting Saturday amid news that the NRA\'s membership had grown to a record 5 million.\n"Millions of Americans are becoming first-time gun owners," Porter said. "The media calls it fear. That\'s not it. It\'s a sense of natural outrage that\'s been building for quite some time."\nPorter, 64, a lawyer from Birmingham, Ala., who defends gun manufacturers, has been building that outrage his whole life. His father, Irvine C. Porter, was president of the NRA in 1959 — when the son says the NRA was "a glorified shooting society." At a breakfast Friday, Porter told grass-roots organizers that they are on the front line of a "culture war."\n"He seems to come out of a mold that\'s much closer to the base than David Keene," said Josh Horwitz of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Whereas Keene was a "steady hand" for the NRA amid controversy, Porter is "a complete wild card," Horwitz said. "The world\'s changing around them, and they\'re hunkering down."\nThe weekend also featured speeches from politicians such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas — who challenged Vice President Biden to a debate on gun violence — and the NRA\'s crowd-pleasing executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre.\n"We will never surrender our guns. Never," LaPierre said. "The media and the political elites can lie about us and demonize us all they want, but that won\'t stop us."\nObservers said the tone of the convention wasn\'t surprising, given the debate over universal background checks in Congress, which the NRA has fought bitterly. "The rhetoric has been ramped up," said Josh Sugarmann of the Violence Policy Center. "They\'ve doubled down on their absolutism."\nAs more than 70,000 people visited the weekend event — primarily for the gun trade exhibits on the floor of the Houston convention center — about 70 protesters held vigil across the street, reading the names of 3,863 victims of gun violence since the shooting in Newtown, Conn., on Dec. 14. The last name on the list: Carlos Serrano, 48, shot in a robbery while going to work Friday 6 miles from the convention.

President Barack Obama is "determined" to curb gun violence, US Vice-President Joe Biden has said, opening high-profile talks on the issue.\nMr Biden, leading the White House effort on gun control policy, said the president could use executive orders.\nHe spoke as New York Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.\nThe gun-control moves follow last month\'s deadly shooting in Connecticut that left 28 people dead.\nAdam Lanza killed 20 schoolchildren and six adults at a primary school in Newtown after first shooting his mother dead, then took his own life.\nMr Biden said the president was "determined to take action" to reduce gun violence.\n\'President will act\'\n"We are not going to get caught up in the notion that unless we do everything we\'re going to do nothing," Mr Biden told reporters before the meetings with gun-safety and victims\' groups began.\n"There is a pretty wide consensus on three or four or five things in the gun safety area that could and should be done."\nBut gun control is a polarising issue in Congress, and Mr Biden warned that Mr Obama would take action independently if necessary, although he gave no specific details.\n"We\'re reaching out to all parties on whatever side of this debate you fall," Mr Biden said. "But the president is going to act. There are executive orders, executive action that can be taken."\nThe White House has pledged to send its proposals to Congress at the end of January, shortly after Mr Obama is sworn into office on 21 January for his second term.\nBut an assortment of gun-rights groups are planning a Gun Appreciation Day over the inauguration weekend.\nThey are encouraging gun enthusiasts to visit gun shops, gun ranges and gun shows.\nNRA and Walmart\nIn his remarks, Mr Biden suggested that the White House would consider a range of measures.\nThe BBC\'s Paul Adams, in Washington, reports that they would almost certainly include reinstating a ban on so-called assault weapons, as well as a more comprehensive system of background checks on people buying guns.\nAlso on Wednesday, Mr Cuomo, whose state has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, came out in favour of a ban on assault weapons and on high-capacity ammunition magazines.\n"Some weapons are so dangerous and some ammunition devices so lethal that we simply cannot afford to continue selling them in our state," he said during his State of the State speech.\nMr Cuomo also called for follow-up checks for people with handgun licences, to make sure they are still qualified to own their weapon, and longer sentences for gun crimes.\nHe has been joined by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who called on policy-makers to examine the US mental health system and broaden access to drug treatment.\nMr Christie also said the impact of violent video games should be examined.\nOn Thursday, the vice-president is scheduled to meet the National Rifle Association, the powerful pro-gun group.\nIn the wake of the Connecticut school shooting, the NRA advocated having armed guards at every US school.\nMr Biden will also meet representatives of Walmart, the world\'s largest retailer and the biggest-seller of guns in the US.\nWalmart had initially declined to send anyone to the White House, but a spokesman told Reuters news agency the retailer had "underestimated the expectation to attend the meeting".\nIn California on Wednesday, the nation\'s largest teacher pension fund took the first step to divest from companies that manufacture guns and ammunition.\nCalSTRS\' investment in companies like Sturm, Ruger & Co and Smith & Wesson Holding Corp account for $11.7m (£7.3m) of the system\'s $155bn portfolio.

(Reuters) - Jillian Soto was stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on a New England highway when she learned over Facebook that her older sister Vicky, a first-grade teacher in Newtown, Connecticut, had died in a shooting.\nCarlee Soto (L) and Jillian Soto, sisters of Victoria Soto, a teacher killed in the December 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, observe a moment of silence during the six-month anniversary of the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut June 14, 2013. Six months after a gunman killed 26 children and adults at the elementary school, families and local officials will mark the day by honoring the victims and renewing the fight for stricter gun control. REUTERS/Michelle McLoughlin\nIn the six months since, Soto said she has become an accidental activist for gun control measures, like expanded background checks in gun purchases, and a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines.\nSoto, who is 24, travels regularly to Washington to meet with lawmakers. Those trips continued even after April, when a background checks bill that enjoyed broad popular support failed in the U.S. Senate.\nThe defeat was a stinging blow to gun control advocates who had sworn that the public’s anger after the Newtown shooting would lead to new laws.\nOn Thursday, Soto and her younger siblings stood with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other elected officials as the Nevada Democrat vowed to revive a background check bill.\n“I think we still have quite a ways to go, but I feel like we are getting somewhere, we are continuing to have the discussion about gun control,” Soto said in an interview. “It’s just going to take some time.”\nBefore the morning of December 14, when a shooter forced his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School and shot 20 students and six adults, Soto said she knew little about guns. But thinking about Vicky’s actions that day - hiding her students and intercepting a spray of bullets - had inspired her to work for gun control.\n“I remember that my sister died fighting for her kids’ safety, fighting for her kids to live. And I will continue to fight like she did, to make sure that nobody else has to go through this pain that my family is enduring,” Soto said.\nStill, asked what her life has been like over the last six months, Soto used a single word: “hell.” Her new experience lobbying lawmakers, while positive in most ways, has been frustrating as well.\n“Having Congress people look family members in the eyes who have been effected so badly and say that there’s nothing we can do, it’s disgusting and they should be ashamed of themselves,” she said.\n‘WORST MOMENT OF MY LIFE’\nSoto was on a ski vacation in Vermont with her boyfriend and two other friends when she learned there had been a shooting at her sister’s school. They jumped into a car and began making their way back to Connecticut, but encountered heavy traffic.\nWhile thumbing through her Facebook page on her phone, Soto began reading condolence notes about her 27-year-old sister.\n“It was by far the worst moment of my life to know that my sister was dead, and my family never even had the opportunity to tell me that,” she said. “And I was stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic when I found out that my sister was dead and there was nothing that I could do.”\n“I remember just knowing that I wanted to do something to get change,” she said.\nShe has been working closely with Newtown Action Alliance and Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group the New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg helped found and largely funds.\nSlideshow (2 Images)\nThrough her work, Soto said she has grown close with others who lost family members in recent mass shootings, like the 2007 attack at Virginia Tech that killed 32 people. And while those relationships provide comfort, the feeling is bittersweet.\n“We are our own group that nobody ever wanted to be a part of,” she said.

(reuters)\nA spate of gun-control bills could put California in the lead when it comes to restricting firearms.\nAccording to the San Jose Mercury News, the gun-control bills, which include proposals to ban a wide range of semi-automatic rifles and strict new regulations on ammunition, could reignite the national debate that erupted after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school last year.\n"When we see movement on the California bills and the sort of tenacity that you had post-Newtown, it makes it really hard for the gun lobby to say the momentum has gone away. And it\'s certainly something Congress pays attention to," Kristin Rand, legislative director at the Violence Policy Center in Washington, D.C. , told the paper. "You can\'t underestimate how important it is for Congress to see movement in the states, especially big states like California."\n[pullquote]\nGun-rights advocates tell a different story.\n"While they may try to reignite their lost momentum, I don\'t think anything California does is going to affect what Washington does," said Larry Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms trade group coincidentally based in Newtown. "We constantly see a barrage of anti-gun, anti-industry legislation being introduced in California, far more than in any other state."\nOn Monday, the state Senate will hear bills that would create a database of all ammo purchases in the state, make it a crime to have a gun that’s not locked up when not being carried, and extends the time someone who makes a violent threat is banned from owning a firearm. The bills reportedly have already been passed by the Assembly.\nOn Tuesday, the San Jose Mercury News reports, a state Assembly committee will hear bills that would ban all semi-automatic rifles with detachable magazines, make it a crime to leave a gun unlocked when a person is not at home, and require people who own high-capacity magazines to get rid of them. The bills have already been passed by the state Senate, the paper reports.

Wounded former Representative Gabrielle Giffords has implored Congress to curb gun violence, at the first hearing on the issue this year on Capitol Hill.\nThe Arizona Democrat, who was shot in the head in a 2011 attack that killed six people, said too many children were dying in shootings.\nBut the National Rifle Association told the Senate judiciary committee that gun control was not the answer.\nThe renewed gun-control drive follows last month\'s massacre in Connecticut.\nTwenty children and six adults were killed in the attack at a primary school in Newtown, which shocked a nation with the world\'s highest rate of gun ownership. Firearms sales in the US have risen since the shooting.\nMs Giffords, who is still recovering after being shot by a mentally ill gunman while meeting her constituents in Tucson, opened Wednesday\'s hearing saying: "Violence is a big problem.\n"Too many children are dying. Too many children. We must do something. It will be hard. But the time is now. You must act. Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you."\nHer husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, also testified.\nThe couple, both gun owners, recently launched a political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, intended to combat firearms violence.\nDuring the hearing, reports of another mass shooting emerged from Ms Giffords\' home state.\nPolice in Phoenix, Arizona, said three people had been shot - one killed and two others critically wounded - at an office complex. The gunman\'s whereabouts were unknown.\nNRA opposes checks\nWayne LaPierre, executive vice-president of the NRA, an influential firearms lobby group, told Wednesday\'s hearing that gun control measures had failed in the past.\nPresident Barack Obama this month proposed sweeping measures on guns, including a renewed ban on assault rifles and wider background checks on buyers.\nBut Mr LaPierre said the government\'s own figures had shown the last assault-weapons ban from 1994-2004 made no impact on lowering crime.\n"Law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals," said Mr LaPierre.\n"Nor do we believe that government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families."\nUnder questioning, Mr LaPierre conceded that his organisation no longer supported universal background checks for gun owners.\nThe Senate judiciary committee is divided on the White House plans, which face a rocky road in both the Democratic-led Senate and Republican-controlled House of Representatives.\nRepublican Senator Orrin Hatch said on Tuesday that he was "a strong supporter of the second amendment" - referring to a clause in the US Constitution on the right to bear arms.\n"And I don\'t intend to change," he added.\nAnother member, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, has already introduced a bill, similar to the White House plan, that would seek to ban assault weapons and limit ammunition magazines to less than 10 rounds.\nBut Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said he believed it would be possible to introduce wider background checks.\nThose buying guns from licensed stores and vendors are required to face a background check, but some purchasers buying guns from private sales at firearms shows and online do not need to do so, an exception often referred to as the gun-show loop-hole.\nPresident Obama has called for background checks in both instances, as well as increased reporting by states on those who are not allowed to buy a gun for legal or mental health reasons.\nThe hearing also took place on the day it emerged that a 15-year-old girl who performed at President Obama\'s inauguration last week had been shot dead in Chicago.\nHadiya Pendleton was attacked by a gunman who opened fire on her and friends as they sheltered from rain in a city park. Police suspect the attacker mistook the group for gang members.

Eight weeks after the massacre of 20 Connecticut first-graders, a ban on the kind of semi-automatic rifle used by the killer remains elusive -- if not impossible.\nSuch a ban became a rallying cry for victims\' families, advocacy groups and politicians supporting tougher gun laws in the emotional aftermath of the Newtown shootings in December.\nPresident Barack Obama still calls for updating a 1994 assault weapons ban that expired 10 years later as part of his package of steps intended to reduce chronic gun violence in America, especially in major cities.\nHowever, fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association and millions of American gun owners has shifted debate away from prohibiting specific weapons to making it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns.\nAlong with a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, Obama also wants to limit magazine clips to 10 rounds, expand background checks to all gun sales, crack down on gun trafficking, and strengthen efforts to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.\nThe multi-faceted proposal provided Congress with options on legislation, enhancing chances of passing some provisions, said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, director of social policy and politics at Third Way, a Washington think tank that proposes policy compromises on major issues.\nWhile her group supports a renewed ban on military style weapons, Erickson Hatalsky said "political reality" dictated a different approach.\n"Keeping guns out of the wrong hands is not only more politically palatable but also more effective to stop gun violence," she explained.\nA Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday showed that 92% of respondents support expanding background checks to all gun sales. In households with guns, support was 91%.\nHowever, a majority of households with guns opposed a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, while the full survey showed 56% of respondents backed the provision.\nObama acknowledged on Thursday that Americans have diverse views on the issue, depending on where they grew up and how they live.\n"There are different realities and we have to respect them," he told House Democrats at their policy retreat, noting rural hunters and urban dwellers come from distinct gun cultures.\nAt the same time, the president called for action, saying "there are commonsense steps we can take and build a consensus around, and we cannot shy away from taking them."\nEarlier this week, White House spokesman Jay Carney made clear that the goal was progress on reducing gun violence, rather than any specific provision.\nCarney called proposals backed by legislators from both parties "the first progress we\'ve seen in many, many years dealing with gun violence." But none of the measures he mentioned -- expanded background checks, cracking down on gun trafficking, criminalizing "straw" purchases in which legal buyers obtain weapons for those unable to do so -- included a new ban on semi-automatic weapons.\nNRA President Bob Keene said he expected few substantive changes in law because "people are smarter than politicians," which means "common sense ultimately prevails."\n"They hope that they can use emotion to achieve an anti-firearms agenda that they haven\'t been able to achieve in the past," Keene told a recent Christian Science Monitor breakfast event.\n"I am convinced that as these things are discussed, that we\'re going to come out about where we have come out in the past," he added.\nHis organization keeps a scorecard for each Washington legislator on gun issues, and spends millions on campaign contributions to favored candidates.\nIn the nearly two months since the Newtown shootings, Obama and the White House have sought to maintain public attention on the issue.\nFour days later, Obama will award the Presidential Citizens Medal -- the nation\'s second-highest civiian honor -- posthumously to the six educators killed with the 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nIn Congress, some influential Democrats join virtually all Republicans in opposing, or at least questioning, a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons like the Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used in the Newtown shootings.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who gets high marks from the NRA for his opposition to past gun control efforts, has indicated support for expanding background checks but refuses to endorse a new weapons ban.\nAccording to Reid, a bill from the Senate Judiciary Committee was unlikely to include an updated weapons ban, but he would allow a vote on the provision during floor debate.\nWeapons like the Bushmaster mimic the appearance and some features of fully automatic military rifles, though they technically do not meet the definition of an assault weapon because they are semi-automatic -- meaning each shot requires a trigger pull.\nSupporters of a ban say such weapons have no place in the general public because they are designed solely for rapid-fire killing capacity, rather than hunting or sport shooting.\nThe NRA and other opponents contend that any limit on private gun ownership violates the constitutional right to bear arms. Even partial steps in that direction, such as prohibiting specific models, are considered a path to potential confiscation or other future elimination of Second Amendment rights, they argue.\nIn recent decades, the NRA has led lobbying efforts that shifted the discussion away from stronger gun controls -- such as an outright ban on handguns and a national registration of gun ownership pushed by top Democrats in the 1980s and 90s -- to the incremental measures under consideration now.\nErickson Hatalsky of Third Way noted examples of the NRA\'s influence in the last significant gun legislation -- the Brady Bill of 1993 that required background checks on guns purchased from licensed dealers, followed by the limited assault weapons ban a year later.\nWhile the Brady Bill led to the background check system in use today, the NRA made sure it didn\'t apply to private sales, such as those at gun shows, she said.\nObama and other Democrats now want to close what they call a loophole to make background checks a requirement for any gun sale.\nThe issue gained prominence after the Columbine high school shootings in 1999 in which three guns used by the two underage killers had been purchased by 18-year-old Robyn Anderson at a Colorado gun show to avoid a background check.\nAnderson later told a Colorado House of Representatives committee that the gun purchases had been "too easy."\nThe 1994 weapons ban targeting military style weapons was gone 10 years later, when Congress let it expire in the administration of President George W. Bush -- an outcome sought by the NRA.\nKeene and other NRA officials argue the ban failed to reduce gun violence because it targeted firearms used in only a fraction of the nation\'s gun violence. They also contend the government isn\'t properly enforcing the background checks created by Brady Bill, making an expansion illogical.\n"We are not willing to support measures we feel unduly burden innocent and law-abiding Americans, and on the other side do not have any real impact on the problem we\'re trying to solve," Keene said.\nTo Erickson Hatalsky, the goal is to get laws on the books that make it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns -- either through private sales or from traffickers through straw purchases.\nMinor exceptions would apply to family members giving guns to each other, or people borrowing guns on a hunting ground, she said.\n"How are they going to stop somebody who\'s a gun trafficker if there\'s no federal law against that now," she wondered.\nA tougher issue involves proposed limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, she said. Larger capacity magazines allow semi-automatic weapons to fire dozens of rounds in seconds.\nAt a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun control last week, Mark Kelly argued that the proposed limit could have prevented the death of a young girl in the Tucson, Arizona, attack that seriously wounded his wife -- former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.\nAccording to Kelly, the 13th shot fired killed 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, and the shooter got tackled when trying to reload. With a 10-round limit, Green might still be alive, he said.\nThe NRA and its supporters say larger-capacity magazines are popular, with millions already in the possession of American gun owners who want them to feel secure against criminals armed with similar firepower.\nThey also contend citizens have the right to such weaponry to protect against future government tyranny, which they say was the intent of the Second Amendment\'s right to bear arms.\nErickson Hatalsky rejected any inference by the NRA or its supporters that Obama\'s proposals or other measures being discussed in Congress amount to taking away people\'s guns.\nShe praised the president\'s strategy of presenting a broad package for Congress to consider, saying: "It behooves people who are working on this issue to keep the NRA arguing about lots of different issues, rather than allowing it to concentrate on one and defeat it."

The national PBS schedule is a placid thing, sketched out well in advance and usually subject to only minor tweaking. So the weeklong programming effort titled “After Newtown,” arriving two months after the mass killings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., represents a major effort in high-metabolism reporting and producing for a network accustomed to moving at a more deliberate pace.\nAnd it’s hard to imagine an ambitious package about gun violence anywhere else on television, with the possible exception of premium cable. It would never make it past the talking stage in the advertiser-supported realm, even though several of the broadcast networks have plenty of underperforming prime-time shows they could pre-empt. It’s painfully obvious, but let’s not miss the chance to say it: a lot of television organizations could do something like this, but PBS is just about the only one that would.\nThat leaves the question of whether the effort — which includes nightly segments on “PBS NewsHour,” which began on Monday, and will encompass episodes of “Frontline” and “Nova” as well as a pair of new documentaries, “Guns in America” and “The Path to Violence” — was worth it. The answer, based on the four centerpiece programs available for review, is a qualified yes.\nThe shows overlap and vary in quality and scope, so that the package as a whole doesn’t have the focus or comprehensiveness it might have had as the product of a network with a more unified news department. On a more concrete level, viewers could ask why three of the programs focus on behavior and brain chemistry rather than on guns.\nThis makes you wonder about both editorial willpower (PBS gets around 10 percent of its financing from the federal government) and editorial astuteness: why emphasize psychology when the national conversation is overwhelmingly about gun control? (At least one “NewsHour” segment as well as “Washington Week With Gwen Ifill” on Friday will address gun control directly.)\nAny such doubts are not assuaged by the documentary “Guns in America” on Tuesday night. A polished exercise in tasteful neutrality, it pings back and forth like a metronome between gun-control and gun-rights advocates, leaving their arguments unexamined while laying out a history of the role of firearms in American life, beginning with colonial times.\nIn the end the case for untrammeled gun ownership is made more vividly, if not more substantially — its proponents include David Keene, president of the National Rifle Association, and Cody Wilson, who encourages the home manufacture of AR-15 rifles using 3-D digital printers — while the cautionary voices tend to belong to historians and law enforcement officials, who speak with an inherent reserve.\nThe gun lobby also wins the battle of imagery: scenes of hunters and target shooters in green fields and forests support its case, while shots of Chicago’s violent streets can argue either for regulation or for the need to own a gun for self-defense. You can divine a glimmer of liberal intent, however, in the treatment of Jim Supica, director of the National Firearms Museum, whose reverent presentations of muskets and pistols have an unexpectedly comic effect.\nThe focus shifts firmly to psychology in Tuesday’s “Frontline” episode, “Raising Adam Lanza,” which follows two reporters for The Hartford Courant as they investigate the relationship between Lanza, the Newtown gunman, and his mother, Nancy, who was the first of his 27 victims. Despite too many lame “All the President’s Men”-style scenes of the reporters traveling to interviews and batting around ideas with their editors — including some dangerously speculative theorizing about the Lanzas — the program has the advantage of delivering new information about the mother and son, from several acquaintances who had not spoken previously in public.\nThe new details are in no way conclusive, however, and we’re no closer to an answer for Adam Lanza’s motives, though the program indirectly floats a theory that his aversion to change may have been exacerbated by a proposed move to an out-of-state college.\nThe “Nova” episode, “Mind of a Rampage Killer,” and the documentary “The Path to Violence” on Wednesday are broad medical and psychological reports that don’t directly address the Newtown shootings. “Nova” starts out by asking whether the chemistry and architecture of the brain can be tied to violent behavior in young men — with the answer being a solid “probably” — before moving on to nature versus nurture, actuarial models for predicting violence and anecdotal accounts of depression and psychopathy among boys.\nThe wandering focus is frustrating (it could be interpreted as a reluctance to dwell too long on any one issue, when the entire question of physiological triggers for violence is controversial), but the individual segments are all quite interesting.\nThe final documentary, “The Path to Violence,” is, in the corporate vernacular, solutions-oriented. Taking as its starting point a study of thwarted school attacks — the program claims that there have been more than 120 such instances in the last decade — it talks to experts in “threat assessment” about ways that schools can be made more safe without impinging too heavily on civil liberties. Wrapped in the soothing narration of Sam Waterston, it’s a reassuring coda to an amorphous but unsettling batch of broadcasts.

US President Barack Obama has marked the anniversary of the Sandy Hook school shootings by urging Americans to push for tighter gun control.\nHe said the United States had to "do more to keep dangerous people from getting their hands on guns so easily".\nTwenty children and six school workers were killed at the elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, a year ago.\nOn Friday, two students were shot and wounded by another student at a school in Colorado.\nThe gunman later died, apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\'Troubled minds\'\nMr Obama and his wife Michelle observed a moment of silence at the White House and lit candles in memory of those who died.\nIn his weekly radio address, Mr Obama urged Americans to do more to restrict gun ownership and improve mental healthcare - or, as he put it, "heal troubled minds".\n"We have to do everything we can to protect our children from harm and make them feel loved, and valued, and cared for,\'\' he said.\nPresident Obama called for stricter gun laws following the tragedy, but Congress has rejected every one.\nIn the town itself, some of the bereaved held small ceremonies but the media were asked to stay away.\n"The community needs time to be alone and to reflect on our past year in personal ways, without a camera or a microphone," First Selectman Pat Llodra told a news conference this week.\nThe bells at St Rose of Lima church in Newtown rang 26 times - once for each of gunman Adam Lanza\'s victims at the school.\nHe was 20 years old when he killed his mother in their Newtown home and drove to Sandy Hook to carry out the massacre. He killed himself as police arrived.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - During the past two years as his frustration with a “dysfunctional” Congress has grown, President Barack Obama has resorted to bypassing the legislative branch as he did on Wednesday to implement tighter gun control laws.\n“Where they won’t act, I will,” he said in October 2011 as part of a “We Can’t Wait” campaign he launched 10 months after Republicans took over the U.S. House of Representatives.\nSince then, the president has turned to executive orders, policy directives, waivers, signing statements and other administrative steps to bypass Congress and act on contentious issues, including immigration, welfare, education reform and now gun violence.\nActing in response to the shooting rampage in Newtown, Connecticut, Obama announced 23 executive actions Wednesday designed to ensure guns don’t get into the wrong hands. He also called on Congress to ban the sale of assault rifles, limit the size of ammunition clips and require background checks for all gun sales.\n“Increasingly, what we’re seeing is a lot of the policy-making apparatus of the federal government shifting to the executive branch,” said William Howell, a University of Chicago expert on presidential powers.\nGun rights groups have accused Obama of an unconstitutional power grab.\n“It’s definitely not appropriate for the president to act unilaterally,” said Erich Pratt, director of communications for the Gun Owners of America.\nOBAMA’S ACTIONS ON GUN CONTROL ‘SURGICAL’\nCompared with some of the stronger steps Obama has taken in the past two years, his administrative actions announced Wednesday seem surgical. Most of what he proposed will have to be approved by Congress. He issued no executive order, which is the most formal tool a president has for pronouncing policy.\nObama did issue a presidential memorandum effectively overturning a congressional ban on federal research into the cause of gun violence.\nHe also acted administratively to get health care providers, states and federal agencies to share more information with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. This is an effort to prevent gun sales to people with disqualifying criminal backgrounds or mental health issues.\n“These are all critically important,” said Ladd Everitt, director of communications for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\nEven before Obama announced his unilateral steps on gun violence, critics began accusing him of overreaching his presidential powers. However, political analysts note that presidents since George Washington have used the same tools, especially when Congress is divided, as it is today.\nObama is not relying on executive orders themselves any more than other recent presidents. His 147 orders through four years is roughly the same pace as former President George W. Bush, who issued 294 in two full terms and Bill Clinton, who issued 308 in two terms.\nCONGRESS SLOWED BY GRIDLOCK\nNeither Clinton nor Bush faced a Congress as unproductive as the last one. It failed to pass a budget or a single one of 13 appropriations bills that fund federal agencies. It also has failed to pass a farm bill or overhaul the bankrupt Postal Service.\nOnly a few of the 147 orders Obama has issued have been controversial. Many are relatively modest, such as establishing advisory groups and task forces. Some have more substance, such as ratcheting up sanctions against Iran. And others are politically popular, such as one to identify and reduce regulatory burdens.\nObama used his third executive order, issued two days after his inauguration, to reverse earlier presidential signing statements by then-President George W. Bush that allowed harsh interrogation tactics.\nObama has bypassed Congress on at least four major issues:\nU.S. President Barack Obama (R) and Vice President Joe Biden announce a series of proposals to counter gun violence during an event at the White House in Washington January 16, 2013. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n— In June 2012 he issued what became known as “the mini-Dream Act order.” He directed the Department of Homeland Security not to deport undocumented immigrants brought here as children who meet certain other requirements. This came after a Senate filibuster two years ago killed legislation allowing immigration rights for people brought to the United States illegally as children.\n— In July 2012 he issued an “information memorandum” providing for conditional waivers from the workfare requirements of the 1996 welfare reform law in a way designed to give the states greater flexibility in how they reach the law’s goals.\n— Starting in February 2012, Obama’s Department of Education began issuing waivers giving states greater flexibility in meeting the requirements of the No Child Left Behind law enacted in 2001 as a means to make schools more accountable. Congress had been expected to incorporate many of the changes in a renewal of the act that was due in 2007. But it has failed to act over the past five years.\n— In October 2011, Obama instructed the Justice Department to no longer enforce the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, saying it was unconstitutional. In a response that typifies Republican reaction to Obama’s unilateral moves, former Republican Attorneys General Edwin Meese and John Ashcroft called the move “an extreme and unprecedented deviation from the historical norm.”\nObama’s “mini-Dream Act” order was perhaps his most aggressive. He effectively did for hundreds of thousands of people what Congress had specifically rejected since 2001, putting off the deportation of some who were brought to the country illegally as children by their parents.\n“The Dream Act order is a decision by a president to implement a policy when Congress wouldn’t give him the statute,” said Kenneth Mayer, a University of Wisconsin professor of political science.\nAnalysts say the partisan gridlock of the moment is part of a longer trend in which the legislative branch, established under the Constitution as the first branch of the federal government, is giving way increasingly to a presidency.\n“Congress has been taking themselves out of the game for several decades now,” said Elaine Kamarck, who worked in the White House during the 1990s for then-Vice President Al Gore and now is a public policy lecturer at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.\nObama formalized his intent to act more unilaterally in October 2009, 10 months after Republicans took control of the House.\nRarely does Congress or the Supreme Court reverse executive orders, according to legal scholars. When they are reversed or modified, it usually is by a future president. A rare example came in 1952 when the Supreme Court, ruling in the Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer case, rejected then-President Harry Truman’s use of an executive order to put the steel industry under government control.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate on Wednesday rejected a bipartisan plan to expand background checks for gun buyers, dealing a crippling blow to President Barack Obama’s campaign to curb gun violence after the Newtown school massacre.\nDespite emotional pleas from families of victims of the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings and broad public support nationwide, the plan to extend background checks to online and gun-show sales failed on a 54-46 vote, six short of the 60-vote hurdle needed to clear the Senate.\n“All in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington,” an angry Obama said of the vote, adding the effort “is not over.”\nThe amendment by Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania had represented Obama’s best hope to pass meaningful gun-control legislation after the December massacre of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown.\n“Our hearts are broken. Our spirit is not,” Mark Barden, the father of a victim of the Newtown shootings, said at the White House after the vote, with Obama looking on. “We always knew this would be a long road. We don’t have the luxury of turning back.”\nOther measures backed by Obama - including a proposal to ban rapid-firing “assault” weapons like the one used in Connecticut - also failed in a series of Senate votes that starkly showed the lingering political power of gun rights defenders and the National Rifle Association.\n“It came down to politics,” Obama said, adding too many senators had worried a vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in the next election.\nThe votes were the culmination of weeks of intense negotiations and lobbying over Obama’s proposed gun restrictions. The defeat of the background checks amendment could doom the biggest package of gun legislation Congress has considered in two decades.\n“Shame on you!” a spectator in the gallery shouted as the tally was announced by Vice President Joe Biden, who presided over the Senate votes.\nPolitical momentum for new gun-control laws had dissipated after December’s shooting. Opponents criticized the proposals as government overreach that would infringe on the constitutional right to bear arms, and the NRA mounted a strong lobbying effort against it.\nU.S. President Barack Obama (L) speaks alongside with Vice President Joe Biden and family members of Newtown victims on commonsense measures to reduce gun violence in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, April 17, 2013. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n“Show some guts,” Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told her colleagues before they voted on her amendment to ban assault weapons, which drew support from only 40 senators.\nFour Democrats who will face re-election in conservative, gun-friendly states opposed the Manchin-Toomey background checks amendment - Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Max Baucus of Montana.\nSenate Democratic Leader Harry Reid supported the measure, but changed his vote after it was apparent it would lose in order to preserve his option to bring the measure back up in the Senate.\nFour Republicans backed it: Toomey, Susan Collins of Maine, John McCain of Arizona and Mark Kirk of Illinois.\nPOLITICAL PAYBACK\nSupporters promised political payback for foes of the amendment. Former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, severely wounded in a 2011 mass shooting in Arizona, said in a joint statement with husband Mark Kelly that the Senate “ignored the will of the American people.”\n“We will use every means possible to make sure the constituents of these senators know that their elected representatives ignored them, and put Washington, D.C. special interest politics over the effort to keep their own communities safer from the tragedy of gun violence,” they said.\nThe Manchin-Toomey background checks amendment allowed exemptions for private sales or gifts between families and friends and prohibited the creation of a national registry of guns. Polls show more than 80 percent of Americans support expanded background checks.\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n‘SHAMEFUL SCARE TACTICS’\nBut the NRA had warned members the proposal would require checks for sales and gifts between family and friends and lead to a national registry.\nThe NRA’s assertions are “a lie. That is simply a lie, and anybody who can read knows that is not factual,” Manchin, a strong gun-rights defender, said on the Senate floor on Wednesday.\nReid, a Nevada gun owner and gun-rights defender, accused the gun lobby of “shameful scare tactics” and questioned why his colleagues would reject a proposal backed by nearly 90 percent of Americans.\n“We must strike a better balance between the right to defend ourselves and the right of every child in America to grow up safe from gun violence,” Reid said.\nThe Democratic-led Senate also rejected several Republican-sponsored amendments backed by the NRA that would have expanded gun rights.\nAn amendment from Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa would have replaced the existing gun-control bill with a plan to focus on prosecuting gun crimes, improving mental health records for gun owners and funding improved school safety measures. It was rejected on a 52-48 vote.\n“Rather than restricting the rights of law-abiding Americans, we should be focusing on keeping guns out of the hands of violent criminals, which this legislation accomplishes,” Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz said of Grassley’s measure.

Eight weeks after the massacre of 20 Connecticut first-graders, a ban on the kind of semi-automatic rifle used by the killer remains elusive -- if not impossible.\nSuch a ban became a rallying cry for victims\' families, advocacy groups and politicians supporting tougher gun laws in the emotional aftermath of the Newtown shootings in December.\nPresident Barack Obama still calls for updating a 1994 assault weapons ban that expired 10 years later as part of his package of steps intended to reduce chronic gun violence in America, especially in major cities.\nHowever, fierce opposition by the powerful National Rifle Association and millions of American gun owners has shifted debate away from prohibiting specific weapons to making it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns.\nAlong with a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, Obama also wants to limit magazine clips to 10 rounds, expand background checks to all gun sales, crack down on gun trafficking, and strengthen efforts to prevent firearms from falling into the wrong hands.\nThe multi-faceted proposal provided Congress with options on legislation, enhancing chances of passing some provisions, said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, director of social policy and politics at Third Way, a Washington think tank that proposes policy compromises on major issues.\nWhile her group supports a renewed ban on military style weapons, Erickson Hatalsky said "political reality" dictated a different approach.\n"Keeping guns out of the wrong hands is not only more politically palatable but also more effective to stop gun violence," she explained.\nA Quinnipiac University survey released Thursday showed that 92% of respondents support expanding background checks to all gun sales. In households with guns, support was 91%.\nHowever, a majority of households with guns opposed a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons, while the full survey showed 56% of respondents backed the provision.\nObama acknowledged on Thursday that Americans have diverse views on the issue, depending on where they grew up and how they live.\n"There are different realities and we have to respect them," he told House Democrats at their policy retreat, noting rural hunters and urban dwellers come from distinct gun cultures.\nAt the same time, the president called for action, saying "there are commonsense steps we can take and build a consensus around, and we cannot shy away from taking them."\nEarlier this week, White House spokesman Jay Carney made clear that the goal was progress on reducing gun violence, rather than any specific provision.\nCarney called proposals backed by legislators from both parties "the first progress we\'ve seen in many, many years dealing with gun violence." But none of the measures he mentioned -- expanded background checks, cracking down on gun trafficking, criminalizing "straw" purchases in which legal buyers obtain weapons for those unable to do so -- included a new ban on semi-automatic weapons.\nNRA President Bob Keene said he expected few substantive changes in law because "people are smarter than politicians," which means "common sense ultimately prevails."\n"They hope that they can use emotion to achieve an anti-firearms agenda that they haven\'t been able to achieve in the past," Keene told a recent Christian Science Monitor breakfast event.\n"I am convinced that as these things are discussed, that we\'re going to come out about where we have come out in the past," he added.\nHis organization keeps a scorecard for each Washington legislator on gun issues, and spends millions on campaign contributions to favored candidates.\nIn the nearly two months since the Newtown shootings, Obama and the White House have sought to maintain public attention on the issue.\nFour days later, Obama will award the Presidential Citizens Medal -- the nation\'s second-highest civiian honor -- posthumously to the six educators killed with the 20 first-graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nIn Congress, some influential Democrats join virtually all Republicans in opposing, or at least questioning, a renewed ban on semi-automatic weapons like the Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle used in the Newtown shootings.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who gets high marks from the NRA for his opposition to past gun control efforts, has indicated support for expanding background checks but refuses to endorse a new weapons ban.\nAccording to Reid, a bill from the Senate Judiciary Committee was unlikely to include an updated weapons ban, but he would allow a vote on the provision during floor debate.\nWeapons like the Bushmaster mimic the appearance and some features of fully automatic military rifles, though they technically do not meet the definition of an assault weapon because they are semi-automatic -- meaning each shot requires a trigger pull.\nSupporters of a ban say such weapons have no place in the general public because they are designed solely for rapid-fire killing capacity, rather than hunting or sport shooting.\nThe NRA and other opponents contend that any limit on private gun ownership violates the constitutional right to bear arms. Even partial steps in that direction, such as prohibiting specific models, are considered a path to potential confiscation or other future elimination of Second Amendment rights, they argue.\nIn recent decades, the NRA has led lobbying efforts that shifted the discussion away from stronger gun controls -- such as an outright ban on handguns and a national registration of gun ownership pushed by top Democrats in the 1980s and 90s -- to the incremental measures under consideration now.\nErickson Hatalsky of Third Way noted examples of the NRA\'s influence in the last significant gun legislation -- the Brady Bill of 1993 that required background checks on guns purchased from licensed dealers, followed by the limited assault weapons ban a year later.\nWhile the Brady Bill led to the background check system in use today, the NRA made sure it didn\'t apply to private sales, such as those at gun shows, she said.\nObama and other Democrats now want to close what they call a loophole to make background checks a requirement for any gun sale.\nThe issue gained prominence after the Columbine high school shootings in 1999 in which three guns used by the two underage killers had been purchased by 18-year-old Robyn Anderson at a Colorado gun show to avoid a background check.\nAnderson later told a Colorado House of Representatives committee that the gun purchases had been "too easy."\nThe 1994 weapons ban targeting military style weapons was gone 10 years later, when Congress let it expire in the administration of President George W. Bush -- an outcome sought by the NRA.\nKeene and other NRA officials argue the ban failed to reduce gun violence because it targeted firearms used in only a fraction of the nation\'s gun violence. They also contend the government isn\'t properly enforcing the background checks created by Brady Bill, making an expansion illogical.\n"We are not willing to support measures we feel unduly burden innocent and law-abiding Americans, and on the other side do not have any real impact on the problem we\'re trying to solve," Keene said.\nTo Erickson Hatalsky, the goal is to get laws on the books that make it harder for criminals, terrorists and the mentally ill to obtain guns -- either through private sales or from traffickers through straw purchases.\nMinor exceptions would apply to family members giving guns to each other, or people borrowing guns on a hunting ground, she said.\n"How are they going to stop somebody who\'s a gun trafficker if there\'s no federal law against that now," she wondered.\nA tougher issue involves proposed limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, she said. Larger capacity magazines allow semi-automatic weapons to fire dozens of rounds in seconds.\nAt a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on gun control last week, Mark Kelly argued that the proposed limit could have prevented the death of a young girl in the Tucson, Arizona, attack that seriously wounded his wife -- former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.\nAccording to Kelly, the 13th shot fired killed 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green, and the shooter got tackled when trying to reload. With a 10-round limit, Green might still be alive, he said.\nThe NRA and its supporters say larger-capacity magazines are popular, with millions already in the possession of American gun owners who want them to feel secure against criminals armed with similar firepower.\nThey also contend citizens have the right to such weaponry to protect against future government tyranny, which they say was the intent of the Second Amendment\'s right to bear arms.\nErickson Hatalsky rejected any inference by the NRA or its supporters that Obama\'s proposals or other measures being discussed in Congress amount to taking away people\'s guns.\nShe praised the president\'s strategy of presenting a broad package for Congress to consider, saying: "It behooves people who are working on this issue to keep the NRA arguing about lots of different issues, rather than allowing it to concentrate on one and defeat it."

WASHINGTON — Retired astronaut Mark Kelly, husband of former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, recently purchased an assault weapon to make a point about the ease of background checks for gun owners.\nIn an interview with CNN on Monday, Kelly said his experience highlights the availability of such weapons. "It is a pretty easy thing to do," he said about buying the military-style firearm.\nKelly announced Friday on his Facebook page that he bought an AR-15, one of the 157 military-style weapons that would be banned under a bill pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The panel is set to consider three gun bills Tuesday, including the proposed assault weapons ban authored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.\nHe told CNN that he wanted "firsthand knowledge" of gun issues. Kelly said he plans to buy a weapon at a gun show and to sell a weapon and will write about those experiences as well.\n"Even to buy an assault weapon, the background check only takes a few minutes," Kelly said on Facebook. "Scary to think of people buying guns like these without a background check at a gun show or the Internet. We really need to close the gun show and private seller loophole."\nKelly, a retired Navy captain, and Giffords are both gun owners who have been outspoken about the need for new gun-control measures. Americans for Responsible Solutions, their super PAC, has been running ads featuring Giffords that tout the proposed assault weapons ban and universal background checks.\nKelly said on his Facebook page and in the TV interview that he plans to give the AR-15 to the Tucson Police Department when he receives the weapon. He said he will keep a .45-caliber handgun he purchased at the same time.\nGiffords was shot in the head in January 2011 in a Tucson rampage that left six people dead. President Obama and others have pushed for new gun legislation in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn., in December that left 20 students and six of their educators dead.

The summary says that Mr. Romney paid taxes every year during that period, that the lowest annual federal tax rate was 13.66 percent and that the Romneys gave an average of 13.45 percent of their income to charity during the period.\nI know you think any news not directly from holy messiah and his sycophants is fake,but this information is from the New York Times,,,,,,,,,the official paper of Obama\nhttp://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/romney-to-release-2011-tax-returns/?_r=0\nInstead of listening to the chip radio Obama plugged into your butt,simply use Google sometime.\n\nTake a moment and explain why it is "easier" for a Republican to give away more than 1/3 of his income than it is for a democrat to give away 3%?????

All firearms, ammunition and firearm parts, including firearm frames and receivers, are prohibited in carry-on baggage.\nhttp://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/firearms-and-ammunition\nBTW. Just what part of--\nA well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\nDon\'t you understand? Is it the "well regulated militia" part that has you confused? If so perhaps you should read this.\nThe Court reasoned that the Amendment\'s prefatory clause, i.e., "[a] well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State," announced the Amendment\'s purpose, but did not limit or expand the scope of the operative clause, i.e., "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." Moreover, the prefatory clause\'s history comported with the Court\'s interpretation, because the prefatory clause stemmed from the Anti-Federalists\' concern that the federal government would disarm the people in order to disable the citizens\' militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule.\n\nhttp://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment2/amendment.html\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport  \n \nContrarian the Barbarian \n #152.7 \n\n\nWell, AMVET_66, if they only "affirmed its meaning," then why are you opposed to the law discussed in the article above? After all, if you agree with Scalia, then you must agree with this:\n"We also recognize another important limitation on the right to keep and carry arms. Miller said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those \'in common use at the time.\' [citation omitted] We think that limitation is fairly supported by the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of \'dangerous and unusual weapons.\'" - Justice Scalia, writing for the majority in Heller v. D.C.\n\nSo do you not agree that undetectable firearms are the type of "dangerous and unusual" weapons Scalia was talking about? They certainly aren\'t the types of weapons "in common use at the time."\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport  \n \n\ngunner762 \n #152.8 \n\n\nNevermind that "undetectable firearms" do not exist.\nRun even the most plastic 3d gun thru an xray machine and you will probably see it. The bullets will be quite visible as well.\nYou are fretting about something that does not exist.\n\nThe real fear of communists is that people will be able to construct a means of resisting their secret police, tax collectors and NSA spies in spite of their best efforts to jail, imprison, belittle, humilate and torture those who opose their worldview.\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport', 'type': 'post'}, {'date': 'Mon, 09 Dec 2013 23:13:17 GMT', 'humanLanguage': 'en', 'author': 'So', 'authorUrl': 'http://g-davehylton.newsvine.com/', 'diffbotUri': 'post|3|1864408812', 'html': '<h2><a data-domain-name="greg2505403" href="http://greg2505403.newsvine.com/">Greg-2505403</a></h2>\n<ul><li><a href="http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/09/21835893-senate-extends-ban-on-undetectable-guns-but-nixes-tighter-restrictions#th3887521-c80915128">#153.1</a></li></ul>\n<p>So, How exactly can you prove that?</p>\n<ul><li><a href="http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/09/21835893-senate-extends-ban-on-undetectable-guns-but-nixes-tighter-restrictions">Reply</a></li><li data-placement="top"><a href="http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/09/21835893-senate-extends-ban-on-undetectable-guns-but-nixes-tighter-restrictions">Share</a></li></ul>\n<h2><a data-domain-name="g-davehylton" href="http://g-davehylton.newsvine.com/">So</a></h2>\n<ul><li><a href="http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/09/21835893-senate-extends-ban-on-undetectable-guns-but-nixes-tighter-restrictions#th3887521-c80915210">#153.2</a></li></ul>\n<p>They have sold quite a few guns since last year to the point that it was hard to find guns and amo and the murder rate and # of mass killings hasn\'t gone down.

(AP)\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. – A Democratic campaign office here usually would be quiet this time of year, a few weeks after the state\'s legislature wrapped up work and lawmakers headed off to summer vacations.\nBut even though it\'s not an election year, the office is in full campaign mode, with volunteers working the phones and reviewing maps in anticipation of a new front of modern campaigning -- the recall phase.\nA handful of Democratic state lawmakers in Colorado face recall petition efforts in what looks to be the first wave of fallout over legislative votes to limit gun rights. In an era in which recall efforts are booming, from governor\'s offices down to town councils and school boards, the Colorado efforts will serve as the first test of gun-rights groups\' ability to punish elected officials who expanded gun control laws after last year\'s Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, Conn., shooting massacres.\nIn Colorado, gun-rights activists wasted no time seeking recalls to oust state Senate President John Morse and three other Democratic lawmakers. The targeted lawmakers weren\'t necessarily the main advocates for ratcheting back gun rights, but all come from districts with enough Republicans to give opponents hope they can boot out the Democrats and replace them with lawmakers friendlier to guns. Colorado is the only state outside the East Coast to have adopted significant statewide gun controls this year.\n"Colorado seems to be the testing ground for some of the gun measures, so this has national implications," said Victor Head, a plumber from Pueblo who is organizing a recall attempt against a Democratic senator.\nTwo of four recall efforts in Colorado already have evaporated from lack of support. But in Colorado Springs, Morse opponents are piling up signatures in gun shops and outside libraries and grocery stores. The National Rifle Association sent a political mailer saying it was coordinating the recall effort with local groups, though the local recall petitioners have denied that. The NRA did not return calls for comment on their involvement in the Colorado Springs effort.\nMorse has mounted a campaign to urge voters not to sign petitions. In an indication of the national stakes, that push is largely funded by a $20,000 contribution from a national progressive group called America Votes. The Morse campaign said the donation came through the group\'s local Colorado office.\nThe recall group\'s main funding comes from a $14,000 contribution from a nonprofit run by a local conservative consultant, Laura Carno. She said that contribution was made possible by some out-of-state donors.\n"People in other states that are further down this road, like New York and Massachusetts, are calling up and saying `What can we do to help?"\' Carno said. "This isn\'t what Colorado stands for."\nIn an interview, Morse seemed resigned to facing a recall vote after signatures are verified. He believes national gun-rights supporters are using his district to make a national statement about the political peril officials face if they take on gun control.\n"That\'s what\'s going on here. They want to take out the Senate president," Morse said.\nThe organizer of the Morse recall effort, Anthony Garcia, didn\'t disagree. Garcia doesn\'t live in Morse\'s district but in the northern Colorado town of Brighton. Garcia said Morse was targeted not just because of his votes for gun control but because he\'s a prominent Democrat from a competitive district.\n"It\'s as much about saying Colorado is angry as it is about getting one guy out," Garcia said. "Legislators need to know when citizens are outraged that they can\'t ignore the people."\nImmediate accountability seems to be a common thread in recall attempts, said Joshua Spivak, who tracks recall elections nationwide at the Hugh L. Carey Institute for Government Reform at Wagner College in New York. Technology makes it easier to organize, Spivak said, and modern-day voters watching political activity in real time on Twitter and TV aren\'t content to wait until another election to show their displeasure when they feel ignored.\nSpivak said at least 169 officials at all levels of government faced recalls last year, up from 151 the year before. The number this year could go even higher, he said.\nTechnology isn\'t the only explanation.\n"The other reason," Spivak said, "is that they succeed."\nMost recalls actually fail, as in the case last year of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who survived a recall election after attacking collective bargaining rights for state employees. But compared with re-election campaigns, when incumbents face up to 75 percent likelihood of winning, Spivak said recall elections have a much lower rate of success for incumbents.\nIn Colorado last year, seven recall efforts made it to ballots, all local races, Spivak said. Of those seven, two officials were ousted and two more resigned.\nNationwide, 108 recalled officials last year lost or left office after a recall. That makes the recall a powerful tool -- and one likely to be used more often, Spivak said.\nBack in Colorado Springs, a couple of Morse opponents defended the recall attempt as the best way for citizens to keep their representatives accountable.\n"I believe in gun rights. And he didn\'t listen. He\'s supposed to represent the people, and when he doesn\'t do that, what are supposed to do? Nothing?" asked Bianca McCarl, a 40-year-old merchandiser who is supporting Morse\'s recall.\nAssuming the Morse recall goes to ballots, with an election to be held by late summer, the incumbent holds a slight party registration advantage in the district. He believes most voters liked his gun votes.\nHe\'s counting on the support from voters like Joan Muir, a retiree who placed a pro-Morse sticker on her car bumper after seeing other cars carrying messages calling for his ouster. In an interview, Muir said she was dismayed by the recall campaign.\n"I live here. I\'m for gun control," Muri said. "I don\'t care for guns, period, so they don\'t speak for all of us when they say Morse didn\'t listen to the people."

(reuters)\nA spate of gun-control bills could put California in the lead when it comes to restricting firearms.\nAccording to the San Jose Mercury News, the gun-control bills, which include proposals to ban a wide range of semi-automatic rifles and strict new regulations on ammunition, could reignite the national debate that erupted after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school last year.\n"When we see movement on the California bills and the sort of tenacity that you had post-Newtown, it makes it really hard for the gun lobby to say the momentum has gone away. And it\'s certainly something Congress pays attention to," Kristin Rand, legislative director at the Violence Policy Center in Washington, D.C. , told the paper. "You can\'t underestimate how important it is for Congress to see movement in the states, especially big states like California."\n[pullquote]\nGun-rights advocates tell a different story.\n"While they may try to reignite their lost momentum, I don\'t think anything California does is going to affect what Washington does," said Larry Keane, senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms trade group coincidentally based in Newtown. "We constantly see a barrage of anti-gun, anti-industry legislation being introduced in California, far more than in any other state."\nOn Monday, the state Senate will hear bills that would create a database of all ammo purchases in the state, make it a crime to have a gun that’s not locked up when not being carried, and extends the time someone who makes a violent threat is banned from owning a firearm. The bills reportedly have already been passed by the Assembly.\nOn Tuesday, the San Jose Mercury News reports, a state Assembly committee will hear bills that would ban all semi-automatic rifles with detachable magazines, make it a crime to leave a gun unlocked when a person is not at home, and require people who own high-capacity magazines to get rid of them. The bills have already been passed by the state Senate, the paper reports.

In the early hours on Thursday, CT passed a new comprehensive bipartisan gun responsibility law.\nInteresting read from AP:\nHow Conn. Gun Bill Compares to New NY, Colo. Laws\nGun control measures proposed in Connecticut after the December massacre in Newtown and expected to win approval Wednesday would be among the strongest such laws in the country. Here is a look at how the proposals compare to laws passed this year in Colorado and New York:\nPBS:\nConnecticut legislators are expected to pass sweeping gun-control legislation on Wednesday, becoming the third state since the Dec. 14 shooting in Newtown to do so.\nBut until recently, it wasn’t clear whether any legislation would even come to a vote. Connecticut has several strict gun laws in place — it was one of the few to pass a state assault weapons ban in 1993. But in recent years, the state’s pro-gun groups, using grassroots and legislative pressure, have killed two major pieces of gun-control legislation in a coordinated offensive. They strongly opposed any new laws after Newtown.\nThis time, though, something was different.\nLocal residents in support of gun-control began turning up at hearings that were once largely attended by gun advocates.\nEmpty threats made by the gun lobby. They were ignored by CT legislators.\nBut from beginning to end, the victims were never far away. Around 12:40 a.m. Mitch Bolinsky, a freshman Republican who has been elected from Newtown a month before the tragedy, rose to speak.\n"On Dec. 14, evil visited my town and everything changed,” he said. He cited the strength he’d seen in Newtown, the compassion shown for the town, the painful journey everyone had been through and read the names of those who died at the school. He said the legislation was not perfect, especially on mental health but said his constituents overwhelming supported the firearms provisions and as a result he would vote in favor of the bill.\n"I dedicate my vote to the memory of those whose lives were lost at Sandy Hook Elementary School,” he said.\nMore politics and policy below the fold, including a new gun responsibility poll from Quinnipiac.\n"In every Quinnipiac University poll since the Newtown massacre, nationally and in six states, we find overwhelming support, including among gun owners, for universal background checks," said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. "American voters agree with the National Rifle Association, however, that these background checks could lead someday to confiscation of legally-owned guns."\n"The question is how many of these voters fear confiscation as an abuse of government power and how many are hoping the government uses confiscation to get more guns off the street," Brown added.\nExpecting gun confiscation are Republicans 61 - 25 percent and independent voters 51 - 36 percent, while Democrats say 54 - 32 percent there will not be confiscation. Men say confiscation is likely 52 - 37 percent and women agree 45 - 38 percent.\nDespite that, background checks are supported 91-8.\nBut Scott Wilson, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, said nothing in the new legislation would stop someone like Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old gunman.\n"In his case, he stole the guns and went on a murderous rampage. Limiting magazine capacity or mandating registration will only affect law-abiding persons, not criminals bent on murder," Wilson added.\nThe Connecticut Citizen Defense League? Yeah, these guys.\nWith Congress set to debate the emerging plan to expand background checks, conservatives and Republicans — and even a few red state Democrats — continue to traffic heavily in deliberate misdirection and distortions about the proposal. They are getting widespread media play and are dominating the debate.\nSo I asked Daniel Webster, a leading expert on gun violence who is the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, to respond to many of their arguments. Footnotes are at the end.\nand Greg Sargent:\nRepublican Senators (and too many red state Dems) have fallen into line behind the NRA’s lurid claims not just about the [UN international arms trafficking] treaty, but also about gun control, endorsing its paranoid and false claim that expanding background checks would create a national gun registry. With United States Senators eagerly feeding such fringe views rather than engaging in genuine policy debate, is it any wonder that it’s a major struggle to implement even the most modest and sensible effort to limit the ongoing murder of innocents, one that is supported by nine in 10 Americans?\nAnd what\'s up with sports figures and their own rules? NY Times:\nWith the business of college sports becoming more crucial to a university’s prominence — not to mention its bottom line — the choice of Mr. Pernetti seemed to pay off. Sports at Rutgers were on the rise and, last November, the university received a coveted invitation to join the Big Ten, an athletic conference that guaranteed vast exposure and huge television revenue.\nBut now, with outrage growing over the abusive behavior of Mike Rice — the university’s men’s basketball coach — Mr. Pernetti and the university’s president, Robert L. Barchi, find themselves under scrutiny for their handling of the case. Their jobs may be in jeopardy, and their university is once again attracting unflattering attention just two years after Tyler Clementi, an 18-year-old gay student, killed himself after a bullying incident.

OXON HILL, Md. – Conservatives are all but declaring victory on their defense of gun rights, exuding confidence as calls for aggressive controls in the wake of the Newtown elementary school massacre have given way to scaled-back expectations to firearm restrictions in Congress.\n"They can call me crazy and whatever else they want, but NRA\'s nearly 5 million members and America\'s 100 million gun owners will not back down — not now, not ever," an emboldened Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, told conservatives gathered at an annual conference. He pointedly ignored President Barack Obama\'s most restrictive proposals in his speech, using it instead to assail the one that has the potential of getting approved — a near-universal background check for gun owners.\nIt\'s a sign that LaPierre — and others at the Conservative Political Action Conference — thinks the nation\'s largest pro-gun lobby has successfully beaten back the most limiting proposals.\nIndeed, a bipartisan deal on near-universal background checks for firearms buyers remains a real possibility. And Congress still could pass a ban on high-capacity magazines. But Democrats haven\'t been able to muster enough support, even within their own ranks, to push through an assault weapons ban.\nThat\'s by far the most restrictive of the series of changes Obama and Vice President Joe Biden have sought following the Connecticut school shooting that killed 26 children and educators and a series of deadly shootings in Aurora, Colo., Oak Creek, Wis., and elsewhere.\nIn the hallways of the Conservative Political Action Conference, many activists echoed LaPierre. Few of them talked with urgency about the outcome of an assault weapons ban or some of the other proposed restrictions. And many exuded a quiet confidence that a divided Congress won\'t act on even the more modest proposal to implement mandatory background checks.\n"I don\'t think it\'s going to get done," said Randy Smith, a California technology company owner. "There\'s no way."\nMel Wilcox, a medical professor from Birmingham, Ala., who owns guns and hunts, said he "doesn\'t really have a problem" with the mandatory background checks but said he didn\'t expect Congress to act. "I don\'t think they\'ll ever push something through," he said.\nSeveral activists pointed to simple arithmetic to explain their confidence in limited gun measures: Republicans remain adamantly opposed to restrictions to assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and several Senate Democrats are facing re-election next year in rural states populated with many gun owners.\n"There are too many Democrats who know they won\'t last long," said William Temple, a tea party member from Brunswick, Ga.\nConnor Martin, Marine veteran and a gun owner from Bay City, Wis., said the upcoming re-election campaigns of several Senate Democrats, including Mark Begich of Alaska, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Max Baucus of Montana, would make it extremely difficult for Democrats to muster enough votes to pass the changes.\nIt\'s clear where Republicans in Congress stand on the measures.\nEvery Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted against bills the panel approved this week on background checks and the assault weapons ban. A third measure toughening federal penalties against illegal gun trafficking won committee passage last week with the support of only one Republican — Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the top GOP committee member. The other seven GOP senators opposed it. A fourth bill, slightly increasing federal aid for school safety, passed the committee with bipartisan support.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has said he will decide soon how to bring the measures to the Senate floor, where debate is expected next month.\nIn his speech, LaPierre called the proposal for mandatory background checks for gun owners a "placebo" that would not make schools or streets safer but would lead to a registration of lawful gun owners — lists that he said could be made public in local newspapers.\n"In the end, there are only two reasons for government to create that federal registry of gun owners: to tax them or to take them," he said.\nLaPierre ridiculed Biden\'s suggestion during a Facebook town last month that women like his wife, Jill, could fire "two blasts" from a shotgun if they felt threatened.\n"Have they lost their minds over at the White House?" LaPierre said, noting that Biden has had armed protection in the Senate and as vice president. "You keep your advice. We\'ll keep our guns."\nSupport for the NRA was omnipresent at the conference. Many participants wore red NRA stickers on their coats with the motto, "Stand and Fight," and an NRA booth in the conference\'s exhibit hall offered bright-orange bags with pamphlets and bumper stickers carrying the group\'s message. The sign above the booth underscored the NRA\'s heft: "I\'m a bitter gun owner and I vote."\nProminent Republicans have expressed support from the podium.\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul told attendees that the path forward for the GOP was "rooted in respect for the Constitution and respect for the individual. Part of that respect is allowing Americans to freely exercise one of their most basic rights, the right to bear arms."\nThe White House expressed support Friday that some compromise could be found. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said aboard Air Force One en route to Chicago that nothing proposed by Obama would "take a firearm away from a law-abiding citizen."\n"There\'s plenty of common ground for us to seize, to move forward, that would reduce gun violence in our communities," Earnest said.

USATODAY\nThe bill also focuses on high-capacity ammunition magazines.\nThe National Rifle Associations calls it a misguided attack on constitutional gun rights.\nWASHINGTON — Congressional Democrats, led by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, have reintroduced a bill that would ban assault weapons despite opposition in the Republican-led House and the reluctance of some Senate Democrats.\nFeinstein wrote the original assault weapons ban, which became law in 1994 and expired in 2004. Democratic Reps. Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Ed Perlmutter of Colorado will lead the effort to push the bill through the House.\nThe new bill would do the following:\n• Ban the sale, transfer, importation or manufacturing of about 150 named firearms, plus certain rifles,handguns and shotguns fitted for detachable magazines and having at least one military characteristic.\n• Strengthen the 1994 ban by moving from a two- to a one-characteristic test to determine what constitutes an assault weapon.\n• Ban firearms with "thumbhole stocks" and "bullet buttons."\n• Ban the importation of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines.\n• Ban high-capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.\nThe legislation would grandfather in weapons legally owned on the day of enactment and exempts more than 2,000 specific weapons "used for hunting or sporting purposes."\nFeinstein said changes had been made in the new version to reflect lessons learned from the 1994 law and to keep pace with the technology of the weapons being manufactured today.\n"One criticism of the \'94 law was that it was a two-characteristic test that defined that, and that was too easy to work around," Feinstein said, noting that manufacturers would tweak models to remove one of the two characteristics making the gun legal. "The bill we are introducing today, it will be -- will make it much more difficult to work around by removing a one-characteristic test."\nThe National Rifle Association, which opposed the original ban and the attempts to revive in 2004, dismissed the bill as a misdirected effort to limit Second Amendment rights.\n"Senator Feinstein has been trying to ban guns from law-abiding citizens for decades," said NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam. "It\'s disappointing but not surprising that she is once again focused on curtailing the Constitution instead of prosecuting criminals or fixing our broken mental health system. The American people know gun bans do not work and we are confident Congress will reject Senator Feinstein\'s wrong-headed approach."\nBill supporters said they were under no illusions it will be easy to pass the bill, which faces significant opposition in the Republican-controlled House.\n"This is going to be hard; this is going to be difficult, but to honor those 20 lives and six more in Newtown, we are going to get it done," said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. Twenty children and six adults were killed in a mass shooting with an assault weapon on Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., became emotional as he recalled standing with parents outside the Newtown school who realized their children were not coming out of the school.\n"I came there as a public official but what I saw was through the eyes of a parent and I will never forget the sights and sounds of that day," he said.\nPolice who responded to the shooting said they could not have stopped the massacre because of the assault weapon carried by shooter Adam Lanza, Blumenthal said.\nVictims and relatives of other shootings also joined the lawmakers Thursday.\nColin Goddard was shot four times when a mentally ill student killed 32 people at Virginia Tech in April 2007.\n"I carry three of those four bullets with me now for the rest of my life," he said. "I\'m here on behalf of the 32 Hokies who didn\'t make it that day, and the 32 Americans, the 32 of us that are murdered by guns every single day."\nPresident Obama supports an assault weapons ban among other gun-regulation measures he and Vice President Biden unveiled last week.

BATON ROUGE, Louisiana (Reuters) - In the gun-friendly state of Louisiana, the backlash against President Barack Obama’s proposed restrictions on firearms seems to be everywhere.\nIt can be seen in the frenzied sales and empty racks at Jim’s Firearms store in the state capital, Baton Rouge, where customers have rushed to make purchases as Congress weighs several gun-control bills.\nIt is evident in the state Legislature, where a series of bills aimed at protecting gun owners’ rights have been introduced as a counter-punch to Obama’s push in Washington.\nIt is abundantly clear in the sea of hands that pop up when a congressman asks an overflow crowd in Baton Rouge how many are worried about their constitutional right to bear arms being threatened.\nObama’s call for Americans to stand up against gun violence after the December massacre of 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school reignited a national debate over gun control, and drew calls for expanded background checks on gun buyers and a ban on military-style “assault” weapons.\nA Senate committee will take up at least four gun-control proposals on Thursday.\nBut in Louisiana and other states where traditions of gun ownership and hunting run deep, the Democratic president’s efforts have not just failed to register: they have galvanized opposition to any attempts to restrict firearms - and complicated the prospects for gun-control measures in Congress.\n“This has been a rallying cry for people to draw a line in the sand and say, ‘We are not going to allow this to happen to our guns,’” said state Representative Jeff Thompson, a Republican who has launched a campaign called “Defend Louisiana” to fight federal and state gun-control proposals.\nThe revolt against gun restrictions in states like Louisiana poses a dilemma for some Democrats from conservative, pro-gun states who in recent years have largely managed to avoid dwelling on the issue.\nSenator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana is among a half-dozen Democratic senators from such states who are up for re-election next year and are likely to be crucial in determining what gun-control proposals emerge from the Democratic-led Senate.\nIn Louisiana, Republicans and gun-rights groups are vowing to make Landrieu pay next year if she supports any of the measures. When asked about the pending gun legislation, Landrieu treads carefully.\nWhile people are concerned about the safety of children and what happened in Connecticut, “the other side is very concerned about the government using this incident or other incidents to overreach and restrict their constitutional right to firearms and self-protection,” Landrieu said. “So, it is going to be a challenge.”\nNational polls show overwhelming public support for broader background checks on gun sales, and majority support for more controversial measures such as a ban on assault weapons.\nBut the political reality is quite different in Louisiana, which bills itself as a “sportsman’s paradise.”\nThree-quarters of Louisiana voters backed a state constitutional amendment in November requiring that the most stringent legal standards be used in evaluating whether new laws infringe on gun rights, giving the state what is widely viewed as perhaps the strongest pro-gun laws in the nation.\nGun-rights bills pending in the Legislature, introduced since the Connecticut shootings, include three that would block enforcement of any federal gun-control mandates that conflict with state laws.\nLouisiana is one of 27 states considering laws to block new restrictions or reinforce gun rights, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures.\n‘TAKING OUR RIGHTS’\nAt a recent town-hall meeting in Baton Rouge hosted by Republican U.S. Representative Bill Cassidy, which was billed as a discussion of the economy, about half the questions focused on how to stop Obama’s gun-control proposals.\nWhen Cassidy asked how many in the overflow crowd at a local library were worried about losing their right to bear arms, which is spelled out in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, nearly all raised their hands.\n“I’m concerned that Obama is already going around Congress to do everything as it is. What is going to stop him from taking our rights away?” asked Chris Wade, a retired engineer from Baton Rouge who said he owned hunting rifles and shotguns.\nCassidy, a Baton Rouge physician and a possible challenger to Landrieu in next year’s Senate race, said he did not think Obama’s proposals would keep guns out of the hands of criminals or do anything to stop massacres like the one in Connecticut.\nHis views are echoed by others in the Republican majority in the U.S. House, which is likely to narrow whatever gun-control legislation emerges from the Senate.\n“If we’re just talking about feel-good legislation that makes people think the president is doing something, I’m not going to support it,” Cassidy said in an interview.\nSome in the crowd said the proposals could be a step toward a national registry of guns, which pro-gun groups such as the National Rifle Association warn could be the first step in a government seizure of citizens’ weapons - a scenario that Obama and other gun-control advocates dismiss as fantasy.\nRepublicans in the state’s congressional delegation, including Senator David Vitter, vow to oppose Obama’s proposals.\nLandrieu - who voted against renewing the initial version of the assault weapons ban when it expired in 2004 after a decade as law - has been non-committal. She said she supported “common-sense reforms” and that she would carefully review proposals before the Senate.\nOther Senate Democrats from gun-friendly states who will be watched closely during the gun-control debate include Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Max Baucus of Montana and Tim Johnson of South Dakota.\nAll are up for re-election in 2014. In a sign of what could be ahead, the NRA ran full-page newspaper ads recently targeting Landrieu, Pryor and Hagan. Democrats control 55 of the Senate’s 100 seats, and while some Republicans have expressed support for some of the gun-control measures, any bill could face trouble if a few Democrats oppose it.\nIn states like Louisiana, where Republican challenger Mitt Romney crushed Obama by more than 17 percentage points in last year’s presidential election, Democrats learned long ago that bucking the gun culture was not a path to success.\n“Politically, there is nothing to be gained statewide in Louisiana by being seen as anything other than a very strong supporter of Second Amendment rights,” said Robert Mann, a professor at Louisiana State University who was an aide to former U.S. Democratic Senator John Breaux.\n“You just don’t want to be talking about guns,” Mann said. “If people are deciding the race on guns, they are going to vote for the Republican.”\nAVOIDING ‘THAT KILLER VOTE’\nJason Dore, executive director of the Louisiana Republican Party, said Landrieu had managed to walk a delicate line on gun control for years.\n“She’s been very smart in the past about not casting that killer vote” against gun rights, Dore said.\nLandrieu in 2009 cast a key vote for Obama’s healthcare overhaul, a plan that analysts say has significant opposition in Louisiana. Republicans hope to highlight that vote in next year’s Senate campaign. Dore said a Landrieu vote favoring gun-control measures would be another boost to her eventual Republican challenger.\nThe debate over gun control has “almost been a favor to our party,” Dore said. “We were down in the doldrums after the (2012) election and it ... re-energized our base.”\nAs in other areas of the country, Obama’s gun-control proposals have been a short-term boon to gun sellers in Louisiana, who have seen their inventories fly off the shelves.\n“It’s created more panic than I have ever seen,” said Cid Dillard, general manager of Jim’s Firearms, one of the biggest gun suppliers in Baton Rouge. Dillard said the store did about six months’ worth of typical sales of sales in the five weeks after the shootings in Connecticut.\n“It was crazy. I had 70-year-olds coming in saying, ‘What’s an AR-15, can I have one?’ They wanted to get one while they could,” he said, referring to a type of semi-automatic rifle used in the Connecticut shootings.\nThe voices in support of gun control have been restrained in Louisiana. Most national gun-control groups do not have a chapter in the state.\nLewis Unglesby, one of Louisiana’s most prominent lawyers, said he had been “totally rebuffed” since speaking recently on a radio talk show and at the Baton Rouge Press Club in favor of a ban on assault weapons.\n“I haven’t heard from a single politician. Pure silence. And they all know how to call me when they want money,” said Unglesby, a self-described hunter who owns guns.\nHolley Haymaker, a family physician who works as a mental-health provider in public schools, was the only one to speak in favor of the congressional gun-control proposals at Cassidy’s town-hall meeting. The response was polite but chilly.\n“It’s a tough argument to make in Louisiana,” she said.

I\'ve been tweeting up a storm with all the various flavors of gun fail. And there are a lot. But as interesting as the stories are, they don\'t do us any good if we don\'t collect them in some more permanent way. So here\'s my first attempt at doing so. But to avoid going completely crazy, I\'m limiting myself (with a few notable exceptions), to incidents from January 2013 only. Where possible, I\'ve tagged each incident with the date on which the actual shooting took place, according to the linked stories.\nBefore we even get started, what is this all about? Does it mean you can\'t or shouldn\'t have guns? No, not by itself. But what it does mean is that people who start out with the best of intentions sometimes get themselves mixed up in some serious trouble, and often people die because of it. These are the stories you should think about every time you handle a weapon, or are near someone else who\'s handling one.\nAnd yes, these stories have special relevance now that more and more people are carrying concealed weapons, often with the idea in mind that they\'re protecting both themselves and the community. It\'s also relevant to the question of whether or not we should be putting guns in our schools. Whether you\'re trained or not, experienced or not, or were raised around guns or not, where guns go, accidents follow. That\'s just statistics. You can do your best to prevent accidents, but everyone thinks they\'re a responsible gun owner, until something happens. Sometimes because you were kidding yourself. And sometimes although you think you did everything right.\nBut the mistakes are very often of the kind that cannot be taken back.\nBefore we begin with January\'s stories, here\'s some follow-up news on some prominent cases that actually happened in December:\n12/08/12: No charges filed in accidental shooting of 7-year-old boy. On a trip with dad to the gun shop. Shot and killed in his safety seat in dad\'s truck, when the pistol everyone thought was unloaded inexplicably fired all by itself while sitting on the center console.\n12/10/12: This one could\'ve been prevented with a simple, "Who\'s there? I have a gun!" Which would have been answered with, "Don\'t shoot, Grandpa! It\'s me!" But instead, he shot first. Because he\'s a fucking ninja. Well, actually, he\'s the pastor of the local Seventh Day Adventist church. But whatevs.\n12/28/12: Involuntary manslaughter charges, though, for the uncle who killed his 12-year-old nephew in a hunting accident. Seems the uncle didn\'t bother obtaining a hunting license, and skipped the mandatory hunting safety course. Wonder why they have those? Probably tyranny.\nNow, new incidents from this month, beginning with the traditional woundings and deaths caused by New Year\'s celebratory gunfire:\n1/01/13: 67-year-old Laurie Eileen Eberhardt was sitting on a patio at the St. Pete Yacht Club watching the fireworks when a bullet struck her hand at about 12:08 AM\n1/01/13: Police say celebratory gunfire a growing problem in Jacksonville after 8-year-old boy is shot in foot on New Year\'s Eve\n1/01/13: 10-yo girl killed by celebratory gunfire to mark the New Year.\nJanuary\'s hunting accidents. I don\'t always tweet about these, because as tragic as they are, hunters know they can be shot. So many others of these accidents happen to people who really think things won\'t happen to them, and that puts them in a different category:\n1/01/13: Duck Hunter killed in accidental shooting laid to rest\n1/01/13: I\'m not really sure if that\'s a deer, but I do have this .50-caliber muzzleloading rifle, so I guess there\'s one way to find out. Hmm. Nope. Not a deer. It\'s a dead guy with a .50-cal. sized hole in him. Weird, because I have a .50-cal. Oh, also, it\'s my dad.\n1/03/13: By "unimaginable coincidence," his friend happened to be driving by the deer’s passage at the same time\n1/03/13: The teen was accidentally shot by his father while deer hunting in Waller County.\n1/10/13: Authorities say the victim apparently walked into the aim of his friend and was struck by birdshot from a shotgun.\n1/12/13: A juvenile was shot in the back Saturday evening while hunting.\n1/12/13: A 13-year-old Tuscaloosa boy was killed Saturday in a hunting accident.\n1/12/13: State police say a man escaped serious injury when he was accidentally shot while hunting in central New Jersey.\n1/13/13: Hudson Barber, the 12-year-old son of Bobby and Allison Barber of Bainbridge, is recovering after seriously injuring his right leg in a hunting accident this past weekend. The accident happened on Sunday, Jan. 13, near Faceville. It was an accidental, self-inflicted shotgun wound, Hudson’s father said.\n1/15/13: "One of the main things they teach is wear hunter orange, be organized on your hunts, and look before you shoot," said Sheriff Darby.\nBelow the fold, January entries in the categories of:\nGeneral Idiocy / "I didn\'t know it was loaded!"\n"I was cleaning my gun, when it suddenly went off!"\nHighly trained, but still ...\nConcealed carry ninjas / "My guns will save me!"\nProtecting the family\n(Continue reading below the fold.)

Police originally did not arrest Zimmerman for six weeks because of Stand Your Ground.\nAlthough Zimmerman’s defense team did not invoke a Stand Your Ground defense, it was still central to the trial and read to the jury as part of its instructions.\n“If we’re sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms, even if there’s a way for them to exit from a situation, is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we’d like to see?” asked Obama on Friday.\n“And for those who resist that idea, that we should think about something like these ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws, I just ask people to consider if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk? And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened? And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws,” he added.\nSen.

Charles Krupa / AP\nPaul Regish of East Hartford, Conn., holds signs as gun rights advocates enter the legislative office building at the Capitol in Hartford, Conn., on April 3.\nConnecticut lawmakers passed a bipartisan package of gun laws that will expand the state’s existing assault weapons ban, impose limits on the size of magazines, and require universal background checks in the state scarred by one of the worst school shootings in American history.\nThe state\'s House voted 105-44 in favor of the bill early Thursday. Democratic Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has said that he will sign the legislation into law.\nState Sen. John McKinney, a Republican who represents the district where the Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre took place, said the bill was far from perfect but a necessary step to ensure the safety of the citizens of the state.\nMoments before the state\'s Senate bill passed by a vote of 26-10 on Wednesday, McKinney praised the state legislature for coming together in a bispartisan way, a model, he said, for the rest of the country.\n"The message we can send if those outside the walls of Connecticut are listening is encourage them to do the same, encourage our elected officials in Washington to put aside the politics and see if they can find some common ground," he said.\nSenate President Pro Tempore Donald Williams, a Democrat, opened the debate with a remembrance of the victims of the Dec. 14 Sandy Hook shooting.\n“All at once there was a report that as many as 20 children had been killed,” Williams said. “For a few seconds it was hard to breathe. I looked around at my colleagues as we recoiled at the horror of what we were learning.”\nAdam Lanza fired off 154 bullets in less than five minutes after entering the school in Newtown with a Bushmaster .223 rifle and several 30-round magazines, investigators have said.\nLegislators in Connecticut worked to achieve a bipartisan consensus on the gun-control package. Sen. Majority Leader Martin Looney, a Democrat, told NBC News in March that he hoped for a “broadly supported bipartisan bill,” but said it was “more important that we have a strong bill that meets the need.”\nThe package put together in Connecticut should serve as an example for national lawmakers, Williams said on Monday.\n“There were some who said the ‘Connecticut effect’ would wear off – that it would wear off in Connecticut and it would wear off across the country,” Williams said. “What they didn’t know was that Democrats and Republicans would come together and work to put together the strongest and most comprehensive bill in the United States to fight gun violence, to strengthen the security at our schools, and to provide the mental health services that are necessary.”\nMalloy called the package “the toughest law passed anywhere in the country.”\nSupporters of stricter gun controls applauded the bill even before it went to a vote.\n“I am grateful that the Governor and Connecticut Legislature took a bipartisan path to a strong gun responsibility bill,” Nicole Hockley, whose son Dylan was killed in the Newtown shooting, said in a statement. “I particularly appreciate that the Legislature listened to us and strengthened the provision on large capacity magazine size. “\nSandy Hook Promise thanked the governor and legislators for “passing the strongest gun responsibility legislation in the nation.”\nDozens of protesters who oppose new gun laws were gathered at the Capitol building in Hartford on Wednesday.\n“I’m prepared to contribute maybe to a class-action lawsuit, follow this up through the legal system,” gun owner Joe Winslow told NBC Connecticut.\n“I want legislators to pass laws that will protect people while not violating the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens,” said Joel Klusek, another anti-gun control protester.\nA post on the blog of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, a group that opposes gun control, said that buses would transport protesters from the parking lot of a Cabela’s sporting goods store in East Hartford to the Capitol and back on Wednesday.\n“Please help us fill buses to the Capitol in Hartford as we assemble in the gallery above the floor where critical votes will take place,” the post read. “This is a last stand to show our legislators that we will not go away and accept the proposal as our fate.”\n“CCDL wishes to thank the NRA for running these buses throughout the day!” the post said.\nThe state Senate passed the bill just moments after President Barack Obama finished a rally in Denver where he continued his push for Congress to pass a bill requiring background checks for every gun owner.\nNext week, the president will travel to Hartford to continue his call for stricter gun control laws as the Senate prepares to take up the bill.\nRelated:\nThis story was originally published on Wed Apr 3, 2013 2:36 PM E

A district attorney and his wife were found shot dead in their Texas home on Saturday, a chilling crime that has become a murder mystery. NBC\'s Gabe Gutierrez reports.\nKaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were found shot to death inside their Forney home Saturday, nearly two months to the day after his top assistant was gunned down on his way to work earlier this year.\nKaufman County Sheriff\'s Department investigators confirmed the deaths to NBC 5 Saturday evening, but officials have had little else to say about the investigation since. Sources close to the investigation told NBC 5 Saturday evening that McLelland and his wife were found at about 4 p.m. that day by a concerned relative or friend who had gone to the house after being unable to reach the couple. Other sources told NBC 5 that the McLelland\'s front door had been forced open and that gunshots had been fired and that an assault rifle was used in the murders.\nOn Sunday afternoon, Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes spoke with the media, but offered little on the investigation thus far and wouldn\'t confirm details released by sources. Byrnes also wouldn\'t speculate on whether the murders are connected to the Jan. 31 slaying of Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse saying, "there is nothing to indicate that, for sure."\nWhile there remains no immediate, confirmed link between Saturday\'s murders and Hasse\'s murder, the similarities between the cases prompted county officials to conduct welfare checks on all employees in the district attorney\'s office Saturday. All were OK, though one former Kaufman County prosecutor was "in hiding" Saturday evening and said others were as well.\nMeanwhile, as a connection between the Hasse and McLelland murders is explored, investigators continue to search for possible connections between Hasse\'s murder, the slaying of Colorado prison official Tom Clements and the shooting of Montague County Sheriff\'s Deputy James Boyd that sparked a wild car chase that ended with the fatal shooting of Evan Ebel last week in Wise County.\nKaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland\nByrnes also refused to comment on whether security measures have been put in place for the staff of the district attorney\'s office other than to say they are taking precautions. Byrnes did say that there would be an increased and visible security presence at the Kaufman County Courthouse on Monday.\n"It\'s unnerving to the law enforcement community and the community at large. That\'s why we\'re striving to assure the community that we are still providing public safety and will be able to do that," Byrnes said, about the McLelland murders.\nA tip line has been set up for the investigation and anyone with information to share with investigators is asked to call 1-877-847-7522.\nMcLelland Vowed to Catch Hasse\'s Killer\nWhile police officers are frequently the target of violence while trying to apprehend criminals, attacks on prosecutors are extremely rare, though not unheard of. McLelland said as much in January when speaking about his slain friend when he said Hasse was aware of the dangers associated with being a prosecutor.\nAt the time, he described Hasse as a really, really good man that was an excellent friend and a spectacular prosecutor who wouldn\'t be easily replaced. He also vowed to catch Hasse\'s killers saying, "I hope that the people that did this are watching. Because we\'re very confident that we\'re going to find you, pull you out of whatever hole you\'re in, bring you back and let the people of Kaufman County prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law."\nFBI agents and Texas Rangers, who were still investigating the unsolved slaying of Hasse, are now leading the investigation into Saturday\'s murders, according to a federal law enforcement source.\nMcLelland and his wife, Cynthia Woodward McLelland, have five children including two daughters and three sons. One of the sons is a Dallas police officer.\nNBC 5\'s Ray Villeda and Scott Gordon contributed to this report.\nThis story was originally published on Sun Mar 31, 2013 3:22 PM EDT\nPopular Discussions

On one side were pegboard panels mounted with various assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons -- including a Bushmaster similar to the one used in last month\'s Newtown school massacre.\nBehind the stage stood police officers supporting a renewed ban on such firepower. One by one, victims of gun violence told their brief stories and expressed support for a new federal ban being proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein on some assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons.\nAlmost six weeks after the Connecticut shooting rampage that killed 20 first graders, Feinstein said she planned to introduce her measure later Thursday, with Reps. Carolyn McCarthy of New York and Ed Perlmutter of Colorado doing the same in the House.\nFeinstein\'s proposal would upgrade an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 and also outlaw ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds.\n"These massacres don\'t seem to stop," the California Democrat lamented, listing notorious rampages of past years known by the lone name of their locations -- Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Tucson and Oak Creek.\n"We should be outraged at how easy it is" for attackers to get hold of the semi-automatic weapons or large-capacity magazines used in those slaughters, Feinstein told the event at the U.S. Capitol that she organized.\nHer legislation is opposed by the nation\'s powerful gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association. That means that despite a push by the White House and Democrats for tougher gun control steps, Feinstein\'s full measure is given little chance of winning congressional approval.\nIn a statement on Thursday, the NRA said that Feinstein "has been trying to ban guns from law-abiding citizens for decades."\n"The American people know gun bans do not work and we are confident Congress will reject Senator Feinstein\'s wrong-headed approach," the organization added.\nIn a sign of the gun lobby\'s influence, a nine-day sports and outdoor show scheduled to take place in Pennsylvania next month was postponed Thursday because the NRA withdrew its support over the decision by organizers to ban the display of "modern sporting rifles" -- the kind of semi-automatic weapons targeted by Feinstein\'s proposal.\nAt her Washington event, Feinstein acknowledged that enacting a ban was "really an uphill road," adding: "If anyone asks if we can win this, the answer is we don\'t know, because it\'s really uphill."\nShe then made a plea for people to call their senators and House members to declare "enough is enough," adding that a mobilized public is "stronger than the gun lobby."\nHe insisted that a reasonable ban on semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as strengthening background checks, presented no threat to the constitutional right to bear arms.\n"It\'s not about keeping bad guns out of the hands of good people," Biden said. "It\'s about keeping all guns out of the hands of bad people."\nPresident Barack Obama called for renewing the assault weapons ban as part of his package of gun control proposals announced earlier this month in response to the December 14 Newtown school massacre and overall gun violence in America.\nFeinstein\'s measure would stop the sale, transfer, importation and manufacture of more than 100 specialty firearms and certain semi-automatic rifles, as well as limiting magazines to 10 rounds or less, she said. Not all of the weapons in the bill meet the technical definition of assault weapons.\nThe restrictions would not apply to guns owned before enactment of any law. Feinstein noted her proposal exempts from the ban more than 2,000 models used for hunting or sporting purposes.\n"They are by make and model exempted from the legislation," she said, adding that the old ban had 375 such exemptions.\nThose exemptions were an apparent effort to garner support for the measure from conservative Democrats and others expected to face fierce lobbying by the NRA and constituents.\nSupporters of more gun control acknowledge the constitutional right to bear arms, but argue that rifles capable of firing multiple rounds automatically or semi-automatically exceed the reasonable needs of hunters and other gun enthusiasts.\nThey also contend that high-capacity ammunition magazines provide the capability for mass shootings such as the Newtown massacre.\nThey worry that such a weakening of gun rights would signal a shift that would leave citizens defenseless against criminals and, some also argue, against potential future government tyranny or abuse. Instead, the NRA has called for increasing armed guards at schools to protect students.\nSpeakers at the event organized by Feinstein rejected arguments that anyone beyond the military or law enforcement officers needed such firepower.\n"How are you going to hunting with something like that?" asked Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, pointing to the assault weapons displayed to his left. "You kill something, there\'s nothing left to eat."\nContinuing bloodshed on the nation\'s streets -- with dozens dying every day from gun violence -- should be enough evidence to overcome the past inability to get gun control legislation enacted, he argued.\n"If the slaughter of 20 babies does not capture and hold your attention, then I give up because I don\'t know what else will," Ramsey continued, thrusting a pointed finger for emphasis.\nAt Feinstein\'s request, people who were injured or lost loved ones to gun violence, including several from the Virginia Tech massacre, then offered their support for her efforts.\nPam Simon, a staff member to Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, said she was a few feet away from the congresswoman on the day both were shot outside a Tucson grocery store.\nSome of the weapons on display Thursday are currently against the law in the District of Columbia, and Democratic sources told CNN that Feinstein coordinated with police on being able to have the guns there.\nNBC\'s David Gregory was recently investigated for holding a banned ammunition magazine on the network\'s "Meet the Press" program broadcast from Washington. No charges were brought in that case.\nObama\'s proposals include expanding and strengthening background checks on gun buyers to ensure all sales include screening to prevent weapons from going to criminals and the mentally ill.\nWhile the gun lobby has indicated support for some improvements in background checks, it remains opposed to other steps, saying they won\'t prevent criminals from getting weapons.\nBiden led a panel assembled by Obama in December to examine gun control steps after the Newtown shootings, which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings. Biden\'s recommendations formed the basis of the package of proposals Obama announced this month.\nA recent CNN/Time Magazine/ORC International poll indicated that Americans generally favor stricter gun control, but they don\'t believe that stricter gun laws alone would reduce gun violence.\nIn announcing his gun control package, Obama also signed executive actions that call for tougher enforcement of existing laws and require federal agencies to provide data for background checks.\nNew York state recently enacted a series of new gun regulations, the nation\'s first since the Newtown shootings. Ten other states are reviewing some form of related action.\nThe issue is among the most politically divisive in the country, as demonstrated by the decision by Reed Exhibitions to postpone the nine-day Eastern Sport and Outdoor Show scheduled to start February 2 in Harrisburg.\nOn Tuesday, the NRA withdrew its support for the show due to the decision by organizers to ban modern sporting rifles from exhibition.\n"We had called on Reed Exhibitions to reconsider their decision; unfortunately they have steadfastly refused to do so," an NRA statement said. "As a result, the NRA will not be participating in the upcoming show in Harrisburg or in any other shows hosted by Reed Exhibitions that maintain this policy."\nIn announcing Thursday that the show was off, a Reed Exhibitions official said the intent of excluding "certain products" was to focus on hunting and fishing traditions of the event.\n"It has become very clear to us after speaking with our customers that the event could not be held because the atmosphere of this year\'s show would not be conducive to an event that is designed to provide family enjoyment," said Chet Burchett, the company\'s president for the Americas.\n"It is unfortunate that in the current emotionally charged atmosphere this celebratory event has become overshadowed by a decision that directly affected a small percentage of more than 1,000 exhibits showcasing products and services for those interested in hunting and fishing," he added.

USA TODAY\nAttorney general issues first public comment since verdict\nZimmerman was acquitted of all charges in state court\nJustice Department could bring civil rights charges\nWASHINGTON — Attorney General Eric Holder called the death of Trayvon Martin "unnecessary" Monday and vowed to proceed with a civil rights inquiry after the acquittal of George Zimmerman on murder and manslaughter charges.\nIn his first public comments since Saturday\'s jury verdict in the racially charged case, Holder told a convention of the nation\'s largest black sorority that the federal government is "determined to meet division and confusion with understanding and compassion – and also with truth.\'\'\n"The Justice Department shares your concern. I share your concern," Holder told the Delta Sigma Theta delegates to thunderous applause.\nA jury in Sanford, Fla., found Zimmerman, 29, not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Trayvon, 17, in February 2012. Zimmerman, a Latino neighborhood watch volunteer, claimed self-defense. Trayvon was black.\nThe shooting drew nationwide attention, protests and claims of racial profiling — as did the verdict. NAACP leader Benjamin Jealous was among those who called Saturday night for the Justice Department to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman. Holder is scheduled to address the NAACP\'s national convention Tuesday in Orlando, Fla.\nBy Monday afternoon, more than 325,000 people have signed an online petition started by the NAACP on MoveOn.org calling on the Justice Department to open a civil rights case against Zimmerman. Sunday, Justice officials said they were reviewing the case.\n"This tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised,\'\' Holder told the sorority delegates. "We must not – as we have too often in the past – let this opportunity pass.\'\'\nThe attorney general urged calm in recognition of Martin\'s parents "who have lost the most.\'\'\n"They suffered a pain that no parent should have to endure – and one that I, as a father, cannot begin to conceive,\'\' Holder said. "Even as we embrace their example and hold them in our prayers, we must not forgo this opportunity to better understand one another and to make better this nation we cherish.\'\'\nDiscussing the federal investigation, opened last year, Holder said authorities will "continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law.\'\'\n"We are committed to standing with the people of Sanford, with the individuals and families affected by this incident, and with our state and local partners in order to alleviate tensions, address community concerns and promote healing. … And we will never stop working to ensure that – in every case, in every circumstance and in every community – justice must be done.\'\'\nDelegates said they looked forward to the federal inquiry\'s conclusions.\n"A life was lost,\'\' said Roxanne Booth, 52, a New York pastor. "To have an acquittal is to say that life didn\'t matter. It does matter.\'\'\nLannie Fountain, 79, a delegate from Georgia, said the trial lacked an important voice.\n"I felt like nobody spoke for Trayvon Martin.\'\'\nContributing: John Bacon

More\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Rifle Association is using a Justice Department memo it obtained to argue in ads that the Obama administration believes its gun control plans won\'t work unless the government seizes firearms and requires national gun registration — ideas the White House has not proposed and does not support.\nThe NRA\'s assertion and its obtaining of the memo in the first place underscore the no-holds-barred battle under way as Washington\'s fight over gun restrictions heats up.\nThe memo, under the name of one of the Justice Department\'s leading crime researchers, critiques the effectiveness of gun control proposals, including some of President Barack Obama\'s. A Justice Department official called the memo an unfinished review of gun violence research and said it does not represent administration policy.\nThe memo says requiring background checks for more gun purchases could help, but also could lead to more illicit weapons sales. It says banning assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines produced in the future but exempting those already owned by the public, as Obama has proposed, would have limited impact because people now own so many of those items.\nIt also says that even total elimination of assault weapons would have little overall effect on gun killings because assault weapons account for a limited proportion of those crimes.\nThe nine-page document says the success of universal background checks would depend in part on "requiring gun registration," and says gun buybacks would not be effective "unless massive and coupled with a ban."\nThe administration has not proposed gun registration, buybacks or banning all firearms. But gun registration and ownership curbs are hot-button issues for the NRA and other gun-rights groups, which strenuously oppose the ideas.\nWhether to require record-keeping for private gun sales is holding up a congressional compromise on legislation to expand background checks, now required only for transactions by federally licensed dealers, according to people familiar with bipartisan Senate talks who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.

The Washington Post:\nLife does go on, through Columbine in 1999, through Virginia Tech in 2007, through Sandy Hook in 2012. Each atrocity provides a jolt to the nation and then recedes with little effect, until the next unimaginable event occurs, except each time a little more imaginable. Everything was supposed to change after a man with a semiautomatic weapon mowed down 20 elementary school children in their classrooms last December. But for the politicians, nothing changed. Now, another massacre, another roster of funerals. Again, again, again.\nRobin Abcarian at The Los Angeles Times:\nThere is no mass shooting devastating enough, disgusting enough or shocking enough that the U.S. Congress would be moved to enact reasonable gun legislation like the measures proposed in April by President Obama after 20 first-graders were mowed down last year in Newtown, Conn. [...]\nAnd, as it turns out, when you are the NRA or in its pocket, there is never a "right time" to talk about rational gun measures.\nSo here we are again, another mass shooting in the news, another moment when gun control advocates must once again lean into the fray and not allow themselves be intimidated by people who would rather offer a prayer for the dead than do anything to prevent more killing.\nDavid Frum:\nI write on the day of the killing. Gun enthusiasts say it is inappropriate to talk about gun violence at the time it occurs. Better to wait … and wait … and wait … until time has passed, and the weeping next of kin have vanished from TV, and it’s safe to return to business as usual. The idea of the gun enthusiasts is that the way to show respect for the victims of gun violence is to do everything possible to multiply their number.\nYet the gun enthusiasts do have one point on their side: for all the horror of these massacres, they are only a small part of the story of gun violence in America. Most casualties of gun violence will not die at the hands of a mentally disturbed killer seeking random victims. Most gun casualties occur in the course of quarrels and accidents between people who would be described as “law-abiding, responsible gun owners” up until the moment that they lost their temper or left a weapon where a four-year-old could find it and kill himself or his sister.\nHead below the fold for more analysis on this tragedy.\nSubtract the military setting and the backdrop of the nation\'s capital, and you have a tragically common event: workplace homicide. Nobody shows up for work anticipating a spray of gunfire into the employee cafeteria. But homicides account for 1 out of 10 fatal on-the-job injuries, according to a 2010 study by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. [...]\nEighty percent of those homicides involved guns. The shooters included robbers, estranged partners and angry clients; co-workers or former co-workers accounted for only 12 percent. [...]\nPolice in Washington haven\'t volunteered a motive in the Navy Yard carnage. There\'s no evidence of terrorism, they say, but they haven\'t ruled it out. In the end, like so many workplace attacks, it could well be attributed to two things: A lethal grudge. And a gun.\nThe Washington Post\'s Eugene Robinson:\nOpponents of gun control argue that, instead of infringing Second Amendment rights, we should focus on the fact that most, if not all, of these mass shooters are psychologically disturbed. But many of the officials who take this view are simultaneously trying their best to repeal Obamacare, which will provide access to mental health services to millions of Americans who are now uninsured.\nSo what difference did it really make what motivated Monday’s shooting? Beyond tightening security at military bases, what is our sclerotic political system capable of doing to prevent the next slaughter of innocents?\nThe Hartford Courant:\nJust five months ago, a mile and a half away at the U.S. Capitol, the U.S. Senate defeated a compromise proposal to expand background checks on gun purchases, despite vast public support for the proposal.\nThe gun control proposals had followed the horrific massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December, where a deranged gunman killed 20 children and six educators before taking his own life. The Senate proposal would have required background checks for sales at gun shows and the Internet, closing glaring loopholes in current law.\nIs there a place in America that hasn\'t been touched by a mass shooting? Has it become part of life in this country? About 3,000 people, military and civilian, work in the building where the shooting took place. We ask for senators who voted against the gun control bill to go down there tomorrow and look them in the eye.

One of the most powerful pieces of feature journalism I’ve read in a long time is on the front-page of Sunday’s New York Times. It’s the first chapter in a series by Mike McIntire--who’s now obviously on a beeline to the annual Pulitzer finals--on “the gun industry\'s influence and the wide availability of firearms in America,” titled: “Selling a New Generation on Guns.” I’ll get to this “must-read” in a few paragraphs, but I’m going to “get a little tangential” first.\nQuestion: If there’s a national protest against gun violence, and it’s not covered on Daily Kos, does that mean it doesn’t matter?\nI’ve got to ask: What’s going on here?\nUnless I’m missing something (and I hope I have), there wasn’t a single mention (please, tell me this isn’t so, and I’ll remove this section of this post) in this community regarding THIS national story, yesterday: Co-sponsored by the Washington Arena Stage and “One Million Moms for Gun Control,” thousands of protestors against gun violence filled Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C.; and according to Reuters, “…One Million Moms organized similar events on Saturday in about a dozen cities, including San Francisco and Austin, Texas.”\n(Clarification, as noted in the comments, down below: This is “One Million Moms for Gun Control,” and it\'s NOT affiliated with an anti-LGBT group with a similar name.)\nWASHINGTON | Sat Jan 26, 2013 9:37pm EST\n(Reuters) - Thousands of marchers rallied in Washington in favor of gun control on Saturday, including residents of Newtown, Connecticut, where a mass elementary school shooting reignited the U.S. gun violence debate.\nSpeakers - including Education Secretary Arne Duncan, lawmakers and actors - urged the protesters carrying such signs as "What Would Jesus Pack?" to lobby Congress and state legislators to back gun control measures…\n…\n"…This is about gun responsibility. This is about gun safety. This is about fewer dead Americans, fewer dead children, fewer children living in fear," Duncan said.\nOrganizers backed President Barack Obama\'s call for a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and background checks for all gun sales. They also urged safety training for all buyers of firearms.\nMarchers stretched for several blocks along Constitution Avenue as they approached the rally site in the shadow of the Washington Monument…\nElsewhere in Washington, less than 48 hours earlier, as fellow Kossack Meteor Blades informed us: “Sen. Feinstein\'s assault weapons ban will face stiff resistance from some elected Democrats.”\nAs One Million Moms’ protestor Amy Journo, a Newtown, CT resident with two sons, five and seven years old, who attended Sandy Hook Elementary School, noted in the Reuters story (linked and excerpted above):\n"It\'s difficult to get laws changed when politicians are bought out, but we have to start somewhere…I want to ensure that they (children) are safer, not just my children but all across the United States."\nAnd, this quote brings us (back) full-circle to Mike McIntire’s stunning feature story in Sunday’s NY Times.\nAs you’ll learn in the article--god forbid, if anyone was ever going to walk into an elementary school classroom with an assault weapon again—if the Newtown, CT-based National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) has their way, eight-year-olds throughout America will be fully proficient with firearms, up to and including semi-automatic assault weapons; and, they’ll have the knowledge and skills necessary to take the shooter out!\nI mean, “seriously!” Why waste taxpayer money on training educators how to handle guns, when you may accomplish the same end result by encouraging the parents of students in the second grade to pay for their kids to learn how to handle AR-15s and semi-automatic pistols, instead?\nApparently, as we learn in today’s NYT, this is the logic behind the NSSF’s “First Shots” program. And then, as it’s explained in Mike McIntire’s piece, you’ll learn more about folks like, “Larry Potterfield, the founder of MidwayUSA, one of the nation’s largest sellers of shooting supplies… who said his own children started shooting ‘boys’ rifles’ at age 4, getting young people engaged with firearms — provided they have the maturity and the physical ability to handle them — strengthens an endangered American tradition.”\nYou’ll also read about “Junior Shooters, an industry-supported magazine that seeks to get children involved in the recreational use of firearms, once featured a smiling 15-year-old girl clutching a semiautomatic rifle. At the end of an accompanying article that extolled target shooting with a Bushmaster AR-15 — an advertisement elsewhere in the magazine directed readers to a coupon for buying one — the author encouraged youngsters to share the article with a parent.”\n“Who knows?” it said. “Maybe you’ll find a Bushmaster AR-15 under your tree some frosty Christmas morning!”\nAnd, then there’s this gem from Junior Shooters’ editor Andy Fink, who…\n… acknowledged in an editorial that some of his magazine’s content stirred controversy.\n“I have heard people say, even shooters that participate in some of the shotgun shooting sports, such things as, ‘Why do you need a semiautomatic gun for hunting?’ ” he wrote. But if the industry is to survive, he said, gun enthusiasts must embrace all youth shooting activities, including ones “using semiautomatic firearms with magazines holding 30-100 rounds.”\nIn an interview, Mr. Fink elaborated. Semiautomatic firearms are actually not weapons, he said, unless someone chooses to hurt another person with them, and their image has been unfairly tainted by the news media. There is no legitimate reason children should not learn to safely use an AR-15 for recreation, he said.\n(Bold type is diarist’s emphasis.)\nYou really need to read McIntire’s entire article to get a sense of the truly savage, capitalistic nature of the matter.\nIn the meantime, speaking of capitalism and money, here’s the link to make a donation to “One Million Moms for Gun Control!”

AP\nState bill would ban magazines that hold 15+ rounds\nWyo.%2C Texas have expressed interest in Magpul%27s business\nState Democrats would allow Magpul to sell large magazines out of state\nERIE, Colo. (AP) — Unnoticed amid dozens of tract homes in the Denver suburbs, a nondescript industrial building is suddenly in the middle of the gun-control debate in Colorado.\nMagpul, started in an ex-Marine\'s basement in 1999, is in a standoff with Colorado Democrats who want to restrict the size of ammunition magazines after mass shootings in a suburban Denver movie theater and a Connecticut elementary school. The company has issued lawmakers an ultimatum potentially worth millions: Pass the bill, and the business will move.\nIt\'s a bold threat from a company that, by its founder\'s admission, has distanced itself from politics.\n"The people who wrote the bill didn\'t even know we existed in the state," said Richard Fitzpatrick, the founder and president of the company that produces magazines and other firearm accessories for gun enthusiasts, law enforcement and the military.\nThe warning from Erie-based Magpul underscores the political pressures Democrats are weighing as they advance the strictest gun-control measures lawmakers have ever considered in a state that still prides its frontier spirit. Other gun-control proposals include universal background checks, a ban on concealed firearms on campuses, and holding assault-weapon sellers and owners liable for shootings.\nOpponents need only three Democrats in the Senate to vote no against the magazine proposal to defeat it, and two have already said they won\'t support the bill. But most Democrats are not budging.\n"When you have the means available to you at every single corner to commit a horrendous act, we will continue to see what we\'ve seen, which is the status quo, where unfortunately gun violence and violence in general is prevalent in our communities," said Democratic Sen. Jessie Ulibarri, who will be considering the magazine bill on Monday in the Judiciary Committee. The bill has already passed the House, and Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper has promised to sign it.\nThe bill would make it a crime to have magazines that can carry more than 15 rounds, with a stricter limit of eight for shotguns. People who own larger magazines now would be allowed to keep them.\nAs the debate unfolds, states have made overtures to Magpul, including offering to pay their moving costs. The company won\'t name the states, but Wyoming and Texas have expressed interest in netting the $85 million the company projects it will spend in Colorado next year in payments to suppliers, subcontractors and service providers. Magpul said the move would also impact its 200 employees, plus an additional 400 who work for suppliers and subcontractors.\n"It\'s not so much, \'Oh, these people are making something that\'s going to cost Colorado lives.\' We truly believe this bill will do nothing. It\'s a feel-good measure," Fitzpatrick said. "But these (workers) will be directly affected."\nFitzpatrick said the bill\'s requirement that all magazines have serial numbers adds enough production costs to make it worth leaving. He also said smaller magazines can be easily connected to each other — magazines can be hooked up to make a 60-round magazine, for example — and the company fears it would legally liable if people were to do that.\nDemocrats have tried to ease Magpul\'s fears, amending the bill to make clear that the company can still manufacture magazines of any size, as long as they\'re sold only out-of-state, to the military or law enforcement.\nRepublicans who oppose the restrictions argue Democrats are sending mixed messages about gun control to keep a company in Colorado.\n"It\'s being hypocritical. These things are either bad or they\'re not," said Republican Rep. Brian DelGrosso.\nMagpul argues that limiting magazine sizes will not reduce gun violence, and that criminals will find ways around laws, including going to other states to buy larger magazines. Magpul officials note that some of their products sometimes end up in California, which limits magazine sizes to 10 rounds.\n"The solutions that people want to bring up are hardware solutions," said Magpul Director Duane Liptak. "And they want to talk about this physical piece of equipment that\'s not inherently evil. It\'s not inherently good. It\'s a tool like anything else. It can be used for good, and it can be used improperly by people who have evil in their hearts."\nSupporters of the proposals say Magpul is bluffing and that a move would prove too costly.\n"I don\'t think Magpul is about to pull out," said Bill Hoover, 83, whose grandson AJ Boik was among the 12 killed in the theater shooting. "It\'s going to cost them a bundle of money."\nFitzpatrick said his company is serious.\n"It\'s not really a threat. It\'s a promise," he said.\nSens. Lois Tochtrop and Cheri Jahn are the two Democrats voting against the bill. Both say they don\'t believe it addresses the main problem — mental health — and Tochtrop also cited Magpul\'s potential departure.\n"I think we really need to address that problem. Look at the cause, not the tool," Tochtrop said.

The governor of the US state where 20 young children were shot dead at school in December has signed some of the strictest gun control laws in the US.\nConnecticut's state legislature passed the measures, which include America's first registry of gun offenders, early on Thursday after hours of debate.\nMeanwhile, Maryland's House of Delegates passed a bill requiring fingerprints for gun buyers.\nBut in the US Congress, efforts to pass firearms restrictions are struggling.\nConnecticut Governor Dannel Malloy signed the bill soon after midday, accompanied by families of the Newtown shooting victims. Some of the measures take effect immediately.\nThe state assembly passed the legislation by 105 to 44 after more than a dozen hours of debate.\nAs well as a gun offender registry, the restrictions introduce background checks on all firearms buyers and a ban on new magazines holding more than 10 rounds.\nThe law also expands the state's assault weapons ban by 100 firearms, including the Bushmaster AR-15, which was used by 20-year-old Adam Lanza in December's Newtown shooting.\nBut gun rights groups argue the legislation would not have prevented that massacre.\nNewtown reignited a national debate on firearms control, and led to President Barack Obama making gun safety one of the defining issues of his second term.\nThe president plans to visit Connecticut on Monday as his proposed gun control measures in Congress appear to have stalled.\nMeanwhile, on Wednesday the House of Delegates in the state of Maryland voted on gun control measures that would be some of the most restrictive in the US if approved, as expected, by the state's Senate.\nIn addition to requiring fingerprinting of all gun buyers, Democratic-leaning Maryland would become the first in the US to propose a gun license in nearly two decades.\nThe legislation also limits magazine capacity to 10 bullets, places new restrictions on weapons purchases by the mentally ill and bans more than 40 types of assault rifle.\nWhile opinion polls show that most Americans support stricter gun control, the powerful National Rifle Association lobby group argues that more firearms keep people safer.\nIt insists that the US Constitution enshrines the right to bear arms.\nStates weakening gun laws\nSpeaking on a Thursday at a campaign event in California, President Obama said it would be harder to make progress on gun control than immigration reform - the president's other major legislative push.\nHe visited the state of Colorado on Wednesday to praise the passage of sweeping gun control measures there.\nNew York and California are among other states that have tightened their gun laws since the Newtown school shooting.\nBut according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, while five states have passed seven laws this year curbing firearms access, 10 states have passed 17 laws loosening gun control.\nThey include:\nSouth Dakota allowing school boards to arm teachers\nArkansas now permits guns on college campuses and in churches\nKentucky has changed its rules to make it easier to obtain a concealed gun licence\nTennessee allows employees to bring guns to work and keep them in their cars

Vice president says he\'s considering several recommendations from stakeholders\nUniversal background checks and limiting high-capacity magazines considered\nBiden says he wants to also meet with gun manufacturers\nWASHINGTON — The National Rifle Association took aim Thursday at the White House task force on gun violence led by Vice President Biden, suggesting that the Obama administration is focused on imposing unnecessary restrictions on lawful gun owners in the aftermath of last month\'s shooting tragedy in Connecticut.\nThe powerful gun rights organization\'s sharp rebuke followed a meeting with Biden and gun-owners groups to discuss the White House\'s response to recent mass shootings. The vice president and other top administration officials have been meeting with various stakeholders in the gun debate in an effort to generate a broad proposal on steps to curb gun violence.\n"We were disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment," the NRA said in a statement following the 95-minute meeting on White House grounds. "While claiming that no policy proposals would be \'prejudged,\' this task force spent most of its time on proposed restrictions on lawful firearms owners — honest, taxpaying, hardworking Americans."\nBiden, who was tapped to lead the task force after the Dec. 14 mass shooting at a Connecticut elementary school, said he plans to deliver his recommendations to President Obama by Tuesday, and suggested Thursday that his proposal may include instituting universal background checks and limiting the size of high-capacity magazines.\nBiden said that his proposal might also bolster the ability of the federal government to research gun violence, suggesting he may look for a way to relax rules that prohibit the release of information from the ATF firearms-trace database to anyone other than a law enforcement agency or prosecutor in connection with a criminal investigation\n"There is a surprising, so far, recurrence of suggestions that we have universal background checks," Biden said. He added, "Among ... my former colleagues in the Senate, who have been pretty universally opposed to any restrictions on gun ownership or what type of weapons can be purchased, etc., I have never quite heard as much talk about the need to do something about high-capacity magazines as I have heard spontaneously from every group I have met with so far."\nThe vice president, notably, did not mention re-instituting the assault-weapons ban which expired in 2004, a move backed by several Democratic lawmakers and Obama. A USA TODAY/Gallup Poll published last month following the Connecticut shooting found 51% of respondents oppose an assault weapons ban, while 44% support reinstating the ban.\nBiden, along with Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, were also meeting with entertainment industry executives Thursday, and a separately with some of the nation\'s top gun sellers, including the megaretailer Wal-Mart, to discuss the issue.\nBiden has said that he may recommend Obama use presidential "executive order" power as part of the effort to stem gun violence. Gun-control advocates said that the president could take several steps without congressional action, including bolstering the national instant criminal-background-check system and stepping up prosecutions of felons and others prohibited from buying weapons when they try to purchase them.\nBiden is also hoping to solicit the input of gun manufacturers before making his recommendations.\n"There has got to be some common ground, to not solve every problem but diminish the probability" of mass shootings, he said. "That\'s what this is all about. There are no conclusions I have reached."\nThe NRA had set low expectations for the meeting, but the sharpness of its rebuke was notable.\n"We will now take our commitment and meaningful contributions to members of Congress of both parties who are interested in having an honest conversation about what works — and what does not," the group said.\nThe NRA instead is pushing for the federal government to implement a program to put armed guards in every school in the country.\nThe Advancement Project, a Washington, D.C.-based civil rights group, has long complained that cops in schools actually make safety worse for many kids, making it more likely that they\'ll end up in trouble with the law.\nContributing: Greg Toppo

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. Democratic lawmaker on Thursday proposed a ban on assault weapons, like those used in a Connecticut school massacre last month, and called on the public to help overcome opposition by the powerful gun lobby.\n“Getting this bill signed into law is an uphill battle, I recognize that, but it is a battle worth having,” Senator Dianne Feinstein - flanked by fellow lawmakers, mayors and law enforcement officers - told a packed news conference.\nFeinstein’s bill would ban semi-automatic assault weapons as well as high-capacity ammunition clips like those used by a gunman in the December shooting spree at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 20 children and six adults.\nThe massacre galvanized public support for tougher gun laws, but also rallied pro-gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association to oppose such action.\n“If anyone asked today, ‘Can you win this?’ The answer is we don’t know,” said Feinstein, who asked Americans to pressure Congress.\n“There is one great hope out there and that is you. Because you are stronger than the gun lobby. You are stronger than the gun manufacturers, but only if you stand up,” said Feinstein, a senator from California.\nGun control advocates figure they need to move quickly before lawmakers become distracted with other matters. Feinstein’s legislation mirrors some of the proposals that President Barack Obama offered last week as he vowed to make gun control a top priority in his second term.\nBanning assault weapons is seen as the part of Obama’s package least likely to win approval in Congress. A previous ban expired in 2004 after 10 years. Other portions include expanded background checks for gun purchasers and improvements in mental health treatment.\nWith 310 million guns in civilian hands and 11,000 homicides with firearms last year, the United States is one of the world’s most heavily armed and violent countries.\nFeinstein’s bill would ban semi-automatic rifles that can accept a detachable magazine clip. It would also prohibit clips with more than 10 rounds.\nIn an effort to ease opposition, the bill would exempt any weapon already legally owned as well as 2,258 specific models and makes of hunting and sporting rifles and shotguns.\n“Senator Feinstein has been trying to ban guns from law-abiding citizens for decades. It’s disappointing but not surprising that she is once again focused on curtailing the Constitution instead of prosecuting criminals or fixing our broken mental health system,” the NRA said in a statement.

(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pledged to enact the strictest assault weapons ban in the United States and outlaw all high-capacity magazines in one of the first state-level reactions to the massacre of school children in Connecticut.\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo acknowledges a member of the audience being introduced, before giving his annual State of the State address in Albany, New York January 9, 2013. Cuomo proposed strong restrictions on assault weapons, in his speech on Wednesday. REUTERS/Phil Kamrass\n“Gun violence has been on a rampage as we know firsthand and we know painfully,” Cuomo said on Wednesday in his annual State of the State address, in which he committed New York to leading the country in enacting new gun control laws. “We must stop the madness, my friends. And in one word it’s just enough. It has been enough.”\nIn neighboring Connecticut, Governor Dannel Malloy in his State of the State address urged U.S. lawmakers to tighten federal gun control measures in response to the shooting of 20 children and six adults at Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14.\n“As long as weapons continue to travel up and down (interstate highway) I-95, what is available for sale in Florida or Virginia can have devastating consequences here in Connecticut,” said Malloy, who paused and fought back tears, his voice cracking, when discussing the tragedy at Sandy Hook.\nAs the governors spoke, Vice President Joe Biden said the White House planned to act quickly to curb gun violence and would explore all avenues including executive orders that would not require congressional approval.\nNew York and Connecticut already have among the toughest gun control laws in the country, but Cuomo has complained New York’s ban on assault weapons, for example, is so full of loopholes that it is unenforceable.\nThe law bans magazines with a capacity greater than 10 rounds but exempts magazines produced before 1994. Cuomo said it was virtually impossible to determine whether any magazine was made before or after that date, so he proposed eliminating large capacity magazines regardless of date of manufacture.\n“Nobody needs 10 bullets to kill a deer. End the madness now,” Cuomo said to a rousing ovation in the state capital Albany before state legislators, appointed officials, state employees and invited guests.\nHe also proposed requiring background checks for private sales of guns such as those taking place at gun shows; keeping guns from mentally ill people; and banning direct internet sales of ammunition in New York.\nThe Democratic governor is popular - a Quinnipiac poll last month showed him with an approval rating of 74 percent - and the Democrats control the state assembly, but Republicans hold a majority in the state senate and gun control is less popular in rural upstate New York than in New York City.

Last night, Jon Stewart opened with an illuminating segment on how the NRA has actually prevented the ATF from actually enforcing existing law. You may have heard about some of these measures. But did you know about ALL of them?\nSo there\'s no director of the ATF. So is the ATF like a Montessori agency, where there\'s no director, but agents are just encouraged to be curious, and regulate weapons at their own pace?\nJOHN AVLON, CNN (12/19/2012): The current acting director commutes from Minnesota. He\'s the U.S. Attorney from Minnesota as well as Acting Director of the ATF.\nWhat?!?\nYou\'re telling me this dude, the guy who is the Acting Director of the ATF, has another full-time job. That regulating alcohol, and tobacco, and firearms, is his side gig? He\'s just moonlighting, pickin\' up a little extra dough.\nWhy?? There\'s 7.8% unemployment in this country, we could find someone to take that job who doesn\'t already have another job!\nThe Senate won\'t confirm anybody? Well, who gives a shit? It\'s the director of the ATF, it\'s not a Cabinet-level position or a Supreme Court justice. Why is it the Senate\'s business to even confirm.... (listens to earpiece)\nI\'m being told the Senate has to confirm the ATF director, because apparently Wisconsin Congressman James Sensenbrenner, for some reason, inserted that provision into the PATRIOT Act in 2006. Sorry, I don\'t have footage of that, it was apparently done on the Q.T. I do have footage of Sensenbrenner from that very same year accepting the NRA\'s coveted Defender of Freedom award.\n(audience groans in disgust)\n....\nSo policing over 100,000 gun dealers in this country, with just a couple of thousand agents, who are also responsible for tobacco and alcohol may seem impossible, but here\'s the good news. 18 years ago, a professor analyzed ATF tracing data, and found that 57% of guns used in crimes — the illegal guns — could be traced back to just 1% of licensed gun dealers. All the ATF has to do is create some sort of federal registry of these transactions, trace them back to the bad dealers, and those dealers — the dealers ruining it for the law-abiding gun dealer and citizen, flooding cities with illegal guns — they can be stopped!\nWhat the fuck are you doing?? Why?? That makes no sense!! Was it getting too easy to police illegal guns? "Hey, what if we do it with our arms like this?" (motion of arms being tied behind back)\nAre there any other somewhat comical limits on federal law enforcement\'s ability to enforce federal law? (sound of letter arriving via pneumatic tube)\nI\'m sorry, I normally get that through my ear, but I guess the old pneumatic tube system didn\'t realize the question was rhetorical. But I\'ll bite, let\'s see what we got here. All right, hold on.\n(reads message) Oh! Apparently, the ATF isn\'t allowed to inspect dealers for inventory discrepancies more than once a year. And in reality, get to inspect them once every 17 years. 17 years! I\'m assuming that\'s because the ATF doesn\'t have enough agents, and not that the ATF agents are cicadas.\n....\n(reads message) Oh, I see, we can\'t rely on self-reported inventories either, because the ATF cannot require dealers to keep track of their own inventory!\nYou see, about 10 years ago, a Congressman stuck an amendment into a federal spending bill that severely restricted the ATF\'s ability to do what the NRA says they want them to do, which is enforce existing gun laws! It allowed dealers to ignore police requests for assistance. It denied Congress formerly public crime gun data. It ended the oversight of used firearm sales. It required the destruction of background check records within 24 hours, you know, to make sure no mistakes could be corrected!\nWho did this? What Congressman jammed this amendment into an unrelated spending bill, completely castrating the ATF\'s ability to enforce existing gun laws?\nHoly shit!! Tiahrt!! You\'re the guy from five minutes ago who was saying, "Slow down, states and municipalities, the ATF\'s got the enforcement game. Let the ATF handle it." And then you cut their balls! You have broken my... ti-heart.\nThat amendment couldn\'t be worse if the NRA wrote it themselves. (sound of letter arriving via pneumatic tube) Oh boy.\n....\nVideo and full transcript below the fold.\nFollowing a series of terrible gun tragedies in this country, and let\'s call it 30 years of urban warfare, America is in the midst of a serous conversation about guns. The NRA\'s been very clear that it would meet any attempt to put limits on gun ownership with a great deal of resistance, and they\'re sparing no expense in getting the message out.\nNRA AD: Are the President\'s kids more important than yours? Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school?\nAnd why does he get to veto bills and command an army when we don\'t? All right, so the conversation has started, and we\'re off to a deplorable start.\nI swear to you, if I didn\'t know any better, and I\'m not a big conspiracy guy, after seeing that ad, I would think the NRA is either an elaborate avant-garde Joaquin Phoenix-style joke, or a false flag operation run by Michael Moore in an attempt to discredit responsible gun owners.\nBut anyway, your response, Mr. President.\nBARACK OBAMA (1/16/2013): I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms. ... I also believe most gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible law-breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale.\nHuh. All right, interesting open on his part. I thought he was going to go with, "If you bring up my kids again, I will drone strike your shit to Kingdom Come." But I understand.\nBut anyhow, at that conference today at the White House, the President unveiled legislative proposals and 23 executive actions to begin to address gun violence, including recommendations to limit magazine size, restrict assault weapons — that\'s going to happen through Congress if it happens at all — expand background checks, and oddly enough, also provide money for increased school security, which had originally been suggested by that really charming ad. Um, so how did his recommendations go down with the pro-gun crowd?\nJERRY HENRY, GEORGIA CARRY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (1/16/2013): All the things that he pointed out will only affect law-abiding citizens who already abide by the law. ... We\'ve got over 20,000 gun laws on the books. We need to enforce those gun laws.\nYou know, that is... OK, that\'s true, that thing he said was true. That happens to be entirely accurate. I think we have like 20,000 on the books, we need to enforce those. But lest mayors and governors and local police try and take that enforcement job on themselves, slow down. There\'s no need. As former Kansas congressman Todd Tiahrt pointed out, in a conversation that he had about why mayors should not be actively trying to trace where illegal guns were coming from.\nEX-REP. TODD TIAHRT, R-KS (7/11/2007): And when crimes are committed, or when there\'s a dealer selling guns illegally, we have an organization that goes after them, 24/7, every day. It\'s called the ATF, and they have officers completely assigned to do this.\nThe ATF! The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms! It\'s an actual government agency, not just a traditional Southern wedding gift.\n(audience laughter and applause)\nDepends on where you\'re registered. Although when you get those, they don\'t have to be registered. That\'s the beauty.\nI\'d like the ATF\'s director to explain to us law-abiding citizens, if you\'re out there 24/7, why is this country ass-deep in illegal guns?\nNEW YORK CITY MAYOR MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (12/18/2012): We have not had a director of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Fire for six years.\nOh sure! I\'m supposed to believe Captain Can\'t Have Sugary Drinks! I don\'t trust information from anyone who can\'t handle more than 16 ounces of high fructose carbonated ambrosia.\nPETER JOHNSON, JR. (8/1/2012): We don\'t have a permanent director.\nOh my God, there really is no ATF director! If I heard it on Fox, it must be true!\nSo there\'s no director of the ATF. So is the ATF like a Montessori agency, where there\'s no director, but agents are just encouraged to be curious, and regulate weapons at their own pace?\nJOHN AVLON, CNN (12/19/2012): The current acting director commutes from Minnesota. He\'s the U.S. Attorney from Minnesota as well as Acting Director of the ATF.\nWhat?!?\nYou\'re telling me this dude, the guy who is the Acting Director of the ATF, has another full-time job. That regulating alcohol, and tobacco, and firearms, is his side gig? He\'s just moonlighting, pickin\' up a little extra dough.\nWhy?? There\'s 7.8% unemployment in this country, we could find someone to take that job who doesn\'t already have another job!\nThe Senate won\'t confirm anybody? Well, who gives a shit? It\'s the director of the ATF, it\'s not a Cabinet-level position or a Supreme Court justice. Why is it the Senate\'s business to even confirm.... (listens to earpiece)\nI\'m being told the Senate has to confirm the ATF director, because apparently Wisconsin Congressman James Sensenbrenner, for some reason, inserted that provision into the PATRIOT Act in 2006. Sorry, I don\'t have footage of that, it was apparently done on the Q.T. I do have footage of Sensenbrenner from that very same year accepting the NRA\'s coveted Defender of Freedom award.\n(audience groans in disgust)\nCoincidence!! Unrelated action.\nBut you know, I mean, OK, they don\'t have a director, they still have ATF agents.\nFORMER ATF AGENT JAMES CAVANAUGH (6/14/2011): In 1972, and I went on ATF in the \'70s, there was 2,500 agents. And there\'s still 2,500 agents, 39 years later.\nNot the same ones, though, right?\nSo policing over 100,000 gun dealers in this country, with just a couple of thousand agents, who are also responsible for tobacco and alcohol may seem impossible, but here\'s the good news. 18 years ago, a professor analyzed ATF tracing data, and found that 57% of guns used in crimes — the illegal guns — could be traced back to just 1% of licensed gun dealers. All the ATF has to do is create some sort of federal registry of these transactions, trace them back to the bad dealers, and those dealers — the dealers ruining it for the law-abiding gun dealer and citizen, flooding cities with illegal guns — they can be stopped!\nWhat the fuck are you doing?? Why?? That makes no sense!! Was it getting too easy to police illegal guns? "Hey, what if we do it with our arms like this?" (motion of arms being tied behind back)\nAre there any other somewhat comical limits on federal law enforcement\'s ability to enforce federal law? (sound of letter arriving via pneumatic tube)\nI\'m sorry, I normally get that through my ear, but I guess the old pneumatic tube system didn\'t realize the question was rhetorical. But I\'ll bite, let\'s see what we got here. All right, hold on.\n(reads message) Oh! Apparently, the ATF isn\'t allowed to inspect dealers for inventory discrepancies more than once a year. And in reality, get to inspect them once every 17 years. 17 years! I\'m assuming that\'s because the ATF doesn\'t have enough agents, and not that the ATF agents are cicadas. (audience laughter) Let that insect joke just wash over ya.\nWell, I guess self-reported inventories from dealers are better than nothing.\nOh my God! Why, it\'s Gunther, my messenger pigeon!\n(reads message) Oh, I see, we can\'t rely on self-reported inventories either, because the ATF cannot require dealers to keep track of their own inventory!\nYou see, about 10 years ago, a Congressman stuck an amendment into a federal spending bill that severely restricted the ATF\'s ability to do what the NRA says they want them to do, which is enforce existing gun laws! It allowed dealers to ignore police requests for assistance. It denied Congress formerly public crime gun data. It ended the oversight of used firearm sales. It required the destruction of background check records within 24 hours, you know, to make sure no mistakes could be corrected!\nWho did this? What Congressman jammed this amendment into an unrelated spending bill, completely castrating the ATF\'s ability to enforce existing gun laws?\nHoly shit!! Tiahrt!! You\'re the guy from five minutes ago who was saying, "Slow down, states and municipalities, the ATF\'s got the enforcement game. Let the ATF handle it." And then you cut their balls! You have broken my... ti-heart.\nThat amendment couldn\'t be worse if the NRA wrote it themselves. (sound of letter arriving via pneumatic tube) Oh boy.\nNoooo!!! Gunther, why??? Why would you be in the tube?? You\'re never supposed to cross antiquated message delivery systems like this!\n(reads message) The NRA did write that law.\nWell, it\'s not like the ATF has been completely de-balled. Thanks to the First Amendment, they still do have a YouTube channel that they use to warmly encourage gun dealers to act responsibly.\nATF AGENT PATRICK HOOVER: Although conducting a firearms inventory is not required by federal law, ATF suggests that you conduct a complete firearms inventory at least once a year.\nATF ATTORNEY ERIKA RITT: If you observe a buyer who appears to be under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, and it appears their judgment may be impaired, you may want to deny the sale. Not because it would be a violation of the Gun Control Act to complete the sale... but because that person\'s judgment is likely impaired.\n(shocked audience laughter)\n"But obviously it\'s up to you. It\'s not our job at the ATF to tell you, you can\'t sell guns to drunk people. I will say this, though, to the gun dealers. You can sell the gun to the drunk people, but if those motherfuckers try and get in a car and drive home, you take them down!"\nJon then looked at the the latest in Hurricane Sandy relief and its perilous passage in the House.\nMeanwhile, Stephen looked at the money laundering charges against HSBC with Matt Taibbi.\nHe then looked at the latest disgusting thing Pat Robertson said.\nJon talked with actress Jessica Chastain, and Stephen talked with Tom Brokaw.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - During the past two years as his frustration with a “dysfunctional” Congress has grown, President Barack Obama has resorted to bypassing the legislative branch as he did on Wednesday to implement tighter gun control laws.\n“Where they won’t act, I will,” he said in October 2011 as part of a “We Can’t Wait” campaign he launched 10 months after Republicans took over the U.S. House of Representatives.\nSince then, the president has turned to executive orders, policy directives, waivers, signing statements and other administrative steps to bypass Congress and act on contentious issues, including immigration, welfare, education reform and now gun violence.\nActing in response to the shooting rampage in Newtown, Connecticut, Obama announced 23 executive actions Wednesday designed to ensure guns don’t get into the wrong hands. He also called on Congress to ban the sale of assault rifles, limit the size of ammunition clips and require background checks for all gun sales.\n“Increasingly, what we’re seeing is a lot of the policy-making apparatus of the federal government shifting to the executive branch,” said William Howell, a University of Chicago expert on presidential powers.\nGun rights groups have accused Obama of an unconstitutional power grab.\n“It’s definitely not appropriate for the president to act unilaterally,” said Erich Pratt, director of communications for the Gun Owners of America.\nOBAMA’S ACTIONS ON GUN CONTROL ‘SURGICAL’\nCompared with some of the stronger steps Obama has taken in the past two years, his administrative actions announced Wednesday seem surgical. Most of what he proposed will have to be approved by Congress. He issued no executive order, which is the most formal tool a president has for pronouncing policy.\nObama did issue a presidential memorandum effectively overturning a congressional ban on federal research into the cause of gun violence.\nHe also acted administratively to get health care providers, states and federal agencies to share more information with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. This is an effort to prevent gun sales to people with disqualifying criminal backgrounds or mental health issues.\n“These are all critically important,” said Ladd Everitt, director of communications for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\nEven before Obama announced his unilateral steps on gun violence, critics began accusing him of overreaching his presidential powers. However, political analysts note that presidents since George Washington have used the same tools, especially when Congress is divided, as it is today.\nObama is not relying on executive orders themselves any more than other recent presidents. His 147 orders through four years is roughly the same pace as former President George W. Bush, who issued 294 in two full terms and Bill Clinton, who issued 308 in two terms.\nCONGRESS SLOWED BY GRIDLOCK\nNeither Clinton nor Bush faced a Congress as unproductive as the last one. It failed to pass a budget or a single one of 13 appropriations bills that fund federal agencies. It also has failed to pass a farm bill or overhaul the bankrupt Postal Service.\nOnly a few of the 147 orders Obama has issued have been controversial. Many are relatively modest, such as establishing advisory groups and task forces. Some have more substance, such as ratcheting up sanctions against Iran. And others are politically popular, such as one to identify and reduce regulatory burdens.\nObama used his third executive order, issued two days after his inauguration, to reverse earlier presidential signing statements by then-President George W. Bush that allowed harsh interrogation tactics.\nObama has bypassed Congress on at least four major issues:\nU.S. President Barack Obama (R) and Vice President Joe Biden announce a series of proposals to counter gun violence during an event at the White House in Washington January 16, 2013. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n— In June 2012 he issued what became known as “the mini-Dream Act order.” He directed the Department of Homeland Security not to deport undocumented immigrants brought here as children who meet certain other requirements. This came after a Senate filibuster two years ago killed legislation allowing immigration rights for people brought to the United States illegally as children.\n— In July 2012 he issued an “information memorandum” providing for conditional waivers from the workfare requirements of the 1996 welfare reform law in a way designed to give the states greater flexibility in how they reach the law’s goals.\n— Starting in February 2012, Obama’s Department of Education began issuing waivers giving states greater flexibility in meeting the requirements of the No Child Left Behind law enacted in 2001 as a means to make schools more accountable. Congress had been expected to incorporate many of the changes in a renewal of the act that was due in 2007. But it has failed to act over the past five years.\n— In October 2011, Obama instructed the Justice Department to no longer enforce the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, saying it was unconstitutional. In a response that typifies Republican reaction to Obama’s unilateral moves, former Republican Attorneys General Edwin Meese and John Ashcroft called the move “an extreme and unprecedented deviation from the historical norm.”\nObama’s “mini-Dream Act” order was perhaps his most aggressive. He effectively did for hundreds of thousands of people what Congress had specifically rejected since 2001, putting off the deportation of some who were brought to the country illegally as children by their parents.\n“The Dream Act order is a decision by a president to implement a policy when Congress wouldn’t give him the statute,” said Kenneth Mayer, a University of Wisconsin professor of political science.\nAnalysts say the partisan gridlock of the moment is part of a longer trend in which the legislative branch, established under the Constitution as the first branch of the federal government, is giving way increasingly to a presidency.\n“Congress has been taking themselves out of the game for several decades now,” said Elaine Kamarck, who worked in the White House during the 1990s for then-Vice President Al Gore and now is a public policy lecturer at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.\nObama formalized his intent to act more unilaterally in October 2009, 10 months after Republicans took control of the House.\nRarely does Congress or the Supreme Court reverse executive orders, according to legal scholars. When they are reversed or modified, it usually is by a future president. A rare example came in 1952 when the Supreme Court, ruling in the Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer case, rejected then-President Harry Truman’s use of an executive order to put the steel industry under government control.

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Key measures of New York\'s tough new gun law kicked in Monday, with owners of firearms now reclassified as assault weapons required to start registering the firearms and new limits on the number of bullets allowed in magazines.\nAs the new provisions took effect, New York\'s affiliate of the National Rifle Association planned to file a court request for a federal injunction to immediate halt to the magazine limit.\nGov. Andrew Cuomo calls those and other provisions in the state\'s new gun law common sense while dismissing criticisms he says come from "extreme fringe conservatives" who claim the government has no right to regulate guns.\n"Yes, they are against it, but they are the extremists and the extremists shouldn\'t win, especially on this issue when it is so important to the majority," Cuomo said in a radio interview last week. "In politics, we have to be willing to take on the extremists, otherwise you will see paralysis."\nNew York\'s new gun restrictions, the first in the nation passed following December\'s massacre at a Connecticut elementary school, limit state gun owners to no more than seven bullets in magazines, except at competitions or firing ranges.\nThe new regulations in New York commence as the U.S. Senate prepares to debate expanded gun legislation and weeks after Connecticut joined Colorado in signing into law tougher new gun restrictions.\nThe New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, the state\'s NRA affiliate, has a pending federal lawsuit against the new provisions. Attorney Brian Stapleton said the request for an immediate halt to the magazine limit would be filed electronically, probably late Monday or possibly early Tuesday.\nThe law violates the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens "to keep commonly possessed firearms" at home for self-defense and for other lawful purposes, the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association said in court papers. It is advising members to obey the law in the meantime.

More than a year after the Sandy Hook school shooting, President Obama’s directive to amp up prosecutions of federal gun laws hasn’t made much difference in how many people are charged with gun crimes.\nU.S. attorneys that prosecute such cases charged 11,674 people with breaking federal gun laws in the fiscal year that ended in September, compared to 11,728 people the year before.\n“The federal gun charge numbers are not an accurate reflection of the Department\'s efforts to investigate and prosecute gun violence,” said Allison Price, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, in a statement. “The fact that we may not prosecute a gun case in federal court does not mean the case is not prosecuted at all.”\nMany gun cases are handled at the state and local level, she added. "Our priorities are to keep our kids safe, help prevent mass shootings, and reduce the epidemic of gun violence in this country,” Price said.\nObama’s directive was one of 23 executive actions on gun violence he released last January, a month after the mass shooting at Connecticut’s Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 20 children dead. The president’s legislative efforts to limit ammunition magazine sizes and expand background checks to cover more gun sales died in the Senate a few months later.\nThe Justice Department says it has taken other steps to increase firearms enforcement, including forming a task force that advises federal prosecutors on how to reduce gun violence, and creating a database to allow law enforcement to trace weapons across jurisdictions.\nBut the figures show how ineffectual the president’s executive action was, at least in the short term, in ginning up prosecutions. Without new legislation or increased resources, U.S. attorneys are unlikely to prosecute more gun crimes, experts say.\nThe National Rifle Association and some Republican lawmakers have argued that the Justice Department does not adequately enforce gun laws that are already on the books. Even Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, formerly Obama’s chief of staff, said in October that the feds have done a “horrible” job of prosecuting gun crimes in Chicago .

(REUTERS)\nAs Senate Democrats push ahead with a proposed ban on assault weapons and other gun-control legislation, Republicans are still trying to draw attention to what they see as the bigger issue -- keeping the mentally ill from owning firearms.\nA proposal on the issue was introduced this month by South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who on Thursday again expressed his interest in getting the measure passed.\n“I believe that the best way to interrupt the shooter is to have a mental health system that actually records and enters into the database people who should not be able to buy a gun,” Graham said.\nHe made his remark while voting against a bill passed by the committee to ban assault weapons and high-capacity gun magazines.\nGraham’s proposal would require that people found mentally incompetent be added to the National Instant Criminal Background System – the database for all new gun sales.\nThose added to the list would have to be found incompetent by a federal court or other official body. The proposal is based on a 2005 South Carolina case in which a women pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity for threatening to kill President George W. Bush. The woman, Alice Bolan, was later able to legally buy a gun and attempted to shoot somebody earlier this year.\n“The … case is Exhibit A of a broken background check system,” Graham said. “As astonishing as it sounds, that actually happened.”\nGraham’s proposal was introduced earlier this month and has bipartisan support.\n"I’m a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights,” Arkansas Democrat Rep. Mark Pryor said in support of the bill. “That said, it’s evident that our background check system needs some improvements.”\nUnder the proposal, a person would be added to the database for such reasons as being an imminent danger to themselves or others, found guilty but mentally ill in a criminal case, found guilty by reason of insanity, found incompetent to stand trial, committed to a psychiatric hospital or required to have psychiatric outpatient treatment.\nMeanwhile, several states are addressing the issue.\nNew York passed legislation that requires therapists to report to the state cases of potentially dangerous behavior. And the Maryland and Florida legislatures are considering similar legislation.\nThe Florida proposal attempts to close a loophole that allows the mentally ill to voluntarily commit themselves to treatment to avoid getting added to a database. The bill also would require the mandatory reporting of mental illness.\nThe U.S. Senate committee has now voted in favor of four gun-control measures: the assault weapons ban, more school safety aid, expanding federal background checks on potential gun buyers and helping authorities prosecute illegal gun traffickers.\nHowever, the ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines faces tough odds in passing the full Senate. The measure would need 60 votes, which would require support from Republicans and some Democrats seeking re-election in pro-gun districts.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said Friday that he\'s interested in writing legislation this year improving background checks for gun buyers and cracking down on illegal firearms sales.\nIn an interview, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., provided little detail about his plans. But he said the federal background check system should be fixed to make sure more people with serious mental illnesses don\'t get firearms.\nCriminals and people with significant mental problems are among those barred by federal law from buying guns. States are supposed to supply the federal background check system with purchasers\' mental health records, but often they do not because of privacy rules and other barriers.\n"We want to improve that system to try to screen out people who should not be able to possess firearms," Goodlatte said.\nUntil now, House GOP leaders have only said they will wait to act until the Democratic-run Senate produces legislation. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., could begin writing its own gun curb measure in the next week or two.\nGoodlatte did not say when his panel might write legislation, but he said he would not necessarily wait for the Senate to pass legislation.\nPresident Barack Obama has proposed near-universal background checks. Currently, the checks are only required for purchases from federally licensed gun dealers, not sales between private individuals at gun shows, online or elsewhere.\nGoodlatte said his legislation would be unlikely to require private background checks for private gun sales between people.\nObama also wants to ban assault weapons and ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds. Goodlatte said he opposes those ideas.\nGoodlatte did not say when his panel might write legislation. His comments that the House would begin acting on gun legislation were first reported by Roll Call, a newspaper that covers Congress.\nDetails remain unclear about the mental health of Adam Lanza, who shot 26 people to death at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school in December. But shooters in some recent mass shootings have been afflicted with mental problems, including those involved in the Virginia Tech killings in 2007 and the 2011 Tucson attack that killed six people and wounded 13, including then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz.\nAs other congressional Republicans have done, Goodlatte also complained that current gun laws are not being enforced sufficiently. He and other GOP members of the Judiciary Committee wrote letters Friday to Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, asking for data on federal firearms prosecutions for the past 11 years.

Americans For Responsible Solutions, the gun-control group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly, is airing TV ads in Arizona and Iowa to persuade Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) to back universal background checks.\n"We have a problem -- where we shop, where we pray, where our children go to school," Giffords says to the camera in one of the ads. "But there are solutions we can agree on, even gun owners like us." The screen then says: "Tell Senator Grassley to support background checks."\nGrassley is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that\'s considering all the gun-control legislation, and Flake also is a member of the committee.

Since then, my extensive rehabilitation has brought excitement and gratitude to our family. But time and time again, our joy has been diminished by new, all too familiar images of death on television: the breaking news alert, stunned witnesses blinking away tears over unspeakable carnage, another community in mourning. America has seen an astounding 11 mass shootings since a madman used a semiautomatic pistol with an extended ammunition clip to shoot me and kill six others. Gun violence kills more than 30,000 Americans annually.\nThis country is known for using its determination and ingenuity to solve problems, big and small. Wise policy has conquered disease, protected us from dangerous products and substances, and made transportation safer. But when it comes to protecting our communities from gun violence, we're not even trying — and for the worst of reasons.\nAn ideological fringe\nSpecial interests purporting to represent gun owners but really advancing the interests of an ideological fringe have used big money and influence to cow Congress into submission. Rather than working to find the balance between our rights and the regulation of a dangerous product, these groups have cast simple protections for our communities as existential threats to individual liberties. Rather than conducting a dialogue, they threaten those who divert from their orthodoxy with political extinction.\nAs a result, we are more vulnerable to gun violence. Weapons designed for the battlefield have a home in our streets. Criminals and the mentally ill can easily purchase guns by avoiding background checks. Firearm accessories designed for killing at a high rate are legal and widely available. And gun owners are less responsible for the misuse of their weapons than they are for their automobiles.\nForget the boogeyman of big, bad government coming to dispossess you of your firearms. As a Western woman and a Persian Gulf War combat veteran who have exercised our Second Amendment rights, we don't want to take away your guns any more than we want to give up the two guns we have locked in a safe at home. What we do want is what the majority of NRA members and other Americans want: responsible changes in our laws to require responsible gun ownership and reduce gun violence.\nWe saw from the NRA leadership's defiant and unsympathetic response to the Newtown, Conn., massacre that winning even the most common-sense reforms will require a fight. But whether it has been in campaigns or in Congress, in combat or in space, fighting for what we believe in has always been what we do.\nLet's not be naive\nWe can't be naive about what it will take to achieve the most common-sense solutions. We can't just hope that the last shooting tragedy will prevent the next. Achieving reforms to reduce gun violence and prevent mass shootings will mean matching gun lobbyists in their reach and resources.\nAmericans for Responsible Solutions, which we are launching today, will invite people from around the country to join a national conversation about gun violence prevention, will raise the funds necessary to balance the influence of the gun lobby, and will line up squarely behind leaders who will stand up for what's right.\nUntil now, the gun lobby's political contributions, advertising and lobbying have dwarfed spending from anti-gun violence groups.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former congresswoman Gabby Giffords, grievously wounded in a 2011 mass shooting, made an emotional plea on Wednesday for Congress to take action to curb gun violence, but a National Rifle Association executive said new gun laws “have failed in the past and they’ll fail again.”\nSpeaking haltingly, Giffords implored lawmakers to “be bold, be courageous” as she opened testimony at the first congressional hearing on gun violence since the December 14 massacre in which a gunman shot dead 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.\nResponding to outrage across the country following that incident, President Barack Obama and other Democrats have asked Congress to pass the largest package of gun restrictions in decades.\n“Speaking is difficult. But I need to say something important,” Giffords, who survived a head wound in an assassination attempt in Tucson, Arizona in which six people were killed and 13 others wounded, told the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n“Violence is a big problem. Too many children are dying - too many children. We must do something. It will be hard, but the time is now,” said Giffords, who was accompanied by her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly. “You must act. Be bold, be courageous. Americans are counting on you.”\nObama’s proposals to curb gun violence include reinstating the U.S. ban on military-style assault weapons, limiting the capacity of ammunition magazines, and more extensive background checks of prospective gun buyers, largely to verify whether they have a history of crime or mental illness.\nWitnesses and lawmakers at the hearing agreed on the constitutional right to own guns but clashed over Obama’s proposals, particularly the call for universal background checks for all gun buyers. That is seen as the most likely restriction to gain bipartisan support in a sharply divided Congress.\nWayne LaPierre, executive vice president and CEO of the powerful gun rights lobbying group the National Rifle Association, gave no ground during the hearing and dismissed Obama’s plan to close loopholes in the background check law.\n“Let’s be honest, background checks will never be universal because criminals will never submit to them,” LaPierre said.\nFederally licensed firearms dealers are required to run background checks for criminal records on gun buyers. But the government estimates that 40 percent of purchasers avoid screening by obtaining their guns from private sellers, including those at gun shows.\nKelly, whose wife retired as a Democratic member of the House of Representatives while recovering from her wounds, said tightening background checks for all gun buyers would be one of the most important ways to prevent guns from falling into the hands of criminals or the mentally ill.\n“I mean, I can’t think of something that would make our country safer than doing just that,” Kelly testified, calling it the “common sense thing to do.”\nObama’s gun restrictions face a difficult challenge getting through the Democratic-led Senate and Republican-led House of Representatives, where many Republicans and some pro-gun Democrats have long opposed stronger gun-control laws.\nFormer U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (L) delivers her opening remarks while seated next to her husband, former U.S. Navy Captain Mark Kelly, during a hearing held by the Senate Judiciary committee about guns and violence on Capitol Hill in Washington, January 30, 2013. REUTERS/Larry Downing\n‘AWASH IN GUNS’\nLaPierre said the proposals would not reduce gun violence and called for more active prosecution of current laws and improved protection for schools, including armed guards.\n“Law-abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals,” LaPierre said. “We need to be honest about what works and what does not work. Proposals that would only serve to burden the law-abiding have failed in the past and they’ll fail again.”\nSenator Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, sharply challenged LaPierre, saying the city of Chicago in his home state is “awash in guns.” He cited the murder there on Tuesday of a 15-year-old girl who was an honor student and majorette and had marched in Obama’s inaugural parade last week.\n“Just a matter of days after the happiest day of her life she’s gone,” Durbin said. “We have guns everywhere, and some believe the solution to this is more guns. I disagree.”\nAs the hearing took place, three people were shot at a business complex in Phoenix, Arizona, and police said one was in extremely critical condition in the latest U.S. mass shooting.\nLaPierre and some Republicans on the panel said there has been a decline in the prosecution of gun laws since Obama took office in 2009. “It’s a disgrace,” he said.\nWhile background checks are seen as the most likely common ground in the renewed gun-control debate, Obama’s plan to ban the sale of rapid-firing assault weapons like the one used in the Connecticut shootings faces much tougher opposition.\nSenator Charles Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the committee, said the 1994 federal ban on assault weapons, which expired in 2004, did not stop mass shootings like the one at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999.\n“We should not rush to pass legislation that will not reduce mass killings. Banning guns based on their appearance does not make sense,” Grassley said. “I also question limitations on magazine capacity. Those can be circumvented by carrying multiple guns, as many killers have done.”\nSlideshow (25 Images)\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said the panel hoped to finish its work on gun-control legislation by late February and send it to the Senate floor.\nThat could ignite a fierce legislative battle in Congress at a time when lawmakers are also wrestling with ambitious immigration reform proposals and urgent deadlines to reach agreement on federal spending.\nThe hearing featured a few sharp exchanges, including one between Leahy and LaPierre over the NRA’s position on background checks. “I do not believe, the way the law is working now unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law,” LaPierre said.\nKelly, who along with Giffords recently founded Americans for Responsible Solutions, a group intended to combat gun violence, said the couple was in favor of gun ownership but against gun violence. “When dangerous people get dangerous guns, we are all the more vulnerable,” he said.\nLeahy made clear whatever measures would be considered to rein in gun violence, there would be no move to erode the fundamental right of Americans to own a gun, which is protected under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\nRepublican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a former federal prosecutor, agreed with the NRA that the government needs to better enforce existing gun laws.\n“You have to prosecute,” Sessions said.

TALLAHASSEE, Florida (Reuters) - Every night for the last three weeks about 50 young protesters have slept on the stone floor of Florida’s state Capitol building in a bid to change the state’s Stand Your Ground self-defense law.\nCalling themselves “Dream Defenders”, and inspired by the 1960s African-American civil rights movement, the protesters want to change a law they blame for the acquittal this month of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.\nTheir nights of sleeping in blankets and living off fast food are unlikely to lead to a repeal or major reform of Stand Your Ground, political analysts say.\nSuch a move is virtually out of the question in Florida’s Republican-dominated legislature, according to analysts.\n“Gun rights are big, especially with the blue dog Democrats that Republicans need in Florida,” said Lance deHaven-Smith, a political scientist at Florida State University. “This law is not repealable. Certainly not by the present legislature.”\n“RETURN TO THE WILD WEST”\nThe Zimmerman case sparked a debate on Stand Your Ground legislation that in 2005 amended the statute governing Florida’s self-defense law. The amendment allows a person in fear of serious injury to use deadly force to defend themselves rather than retreat. Jurors in Florida said the law left them no option but to acquit Zimmerman for the shooting death of an unarmed black teenager.\nMartin’s grieving parents, backed by African-American civic leaders, students and politicians, including Attorney General Eric Holder and President Barack Obama, all say the Stand Your Ground law needs to be re-examined.\n“By allowing — and perhaps encouraging — violent situations to escalate in public, such laws undermine public safety,” Holder told the convention of the NAACP earlier this month.\nSome, including civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and singer Stevie Wonder, have gone further, calling for a boycott of Florida until the law is repealed.\nFlorida’s self-defense law and the Zimmerman case are seen by many African Americans as emblematic of a lack of racial equality in the U.S. justice system. According to a study by the Tampa Bay Times, legal defense claims under Stand Your Ground were more likely to be successful when the victim was black.\nSeveral groups, including the Martin family, say they are working on drawing up a Trayvon Martin Law to more narrowly define self-defense in cases that involve racial profiling.\nThe Dream Defenders - who have been joined in their nightly protest by the likes of activist/entertainer Harry Belafonte - say they won’t leave until Florida Governor Rick Scott calls a special legislative session on the Stand Your Ground law.\nScott, a firm supporter of the law, is standing his ground and has rejected their demand after meeting them.\n“This is just one tactic we have, focusing on the governor’s office,” said Phillip Agnew a young union activist from Miami who is the leader of the group. “We are also contacting legislators in their districts.”\nThe National Bar Association, which represents African-American lawyers and judges, threw its weight behind the initiative on Monday and called for Scott to hold a special legislative session to review the Stand Your Ground law.\n“Quite simply. You’ve given a license to kill, to shoot first and ask questions later. It’s a return to the Wild West and Dodge City,” said the association’s president, John Page.\nLAW’S SPONSOR TELLS FEDS “LEAVE US ALONE”\nFlorida became the first state in the country to adopt a Stand Your Ground law when it passed in 2005 with resounding bipartisan approval from Florida legislators, including some leading Democrats who now outspokenly oppose it.\nPolls show the law still enjoys strong support in Florida and at least 21 states have since adopted similar laws, according to the National Council of State Legislatures.\nInspired by an outbreak of looting after a string of Florida hurricanes Florida in 2004, the law was meant to protect law-abiding citizens from prosecution for stopping a violent attack.\nThe law’s leading sponsor says he has no regrets about the legislation despite the public outcry. Dennis Baxley, a conservative Republican state representative and staunch supporter of the National Rifle Association, said recent remarks by the president and Holder questioning the law were misplaced.\n“It’s not a federal issue and they need to leave us alone,” Baxley, 60, told Reuters.\nAdvocates of the law say violent crime has fallen in the state since it was passed. At the same time, justifiable homicides in Florida have climbed to a record 66 cases in 2012 from an annual average of 13 between 2001 and 2005, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\nAfter the Martin shooting, bills were introduced in Florida to repeal or scale-back the self-defense statute, but none even got a committee hearing.\nWhatever happens in the legislature, Stand Your Ground is likely to remain a hot political issue headed into the 2014 electoral season. Democrats and Republicans are likely to make gun control and self-defense core issues, said Susan MacManus, a Tampa political scientist at the University of South Florida.\n“One thing is for sure is that it’s an issue that’s not going to die down soon,” she added.

Congressional lawmakers will face a critical deadline after returning from Thanksgiving break to address a nationwide ban on the production of undetectable guns that is set to expire on Dec. 9.\nThe Undetectable Firearms Act, which was first enacted in 1988 and reauthorized in 2003, makes it illegal to “manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer or receive” any firearm that’s undetectable by metal detectors and X-ray machines.\nThree Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer of New York, Bill Nelson of Florida and Patrick Leahy of Vermont are pushing legislation that would extend the ban to all guns manufactured using so-called three-dimensional printing technology.\nSen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., who objected along with other senators, blocked Schumer\'s request for unanimous consent for a one-year extension to the law before the Senate adjourned last week, according to The Hill.\n“We will be glad to give it serious attention,” Sessions said Thursday, according to the report. “I know it is the kind of thing we probably can clear at some point, but I object.”\nThe National Rifle Association has not publicly stated where it stands on the proposed extension. Gun Owners of America, a smaller gun rights group, told The New York Times that the extension is unnecessary because 3-D printing technology is not widely available.\n“They’re not going to be in Kinkos,” Larry Pratt, the group\'s executive director, told the newspaper. “And at the moment, they can’t fire that many rounds. It’s just not something that we’re going to be dealing with anytime soon.”\nSchumer, however, has said the technology of 3-D printing has advanced to the point anyone with $1,000 and an Internet connection can access the plastic parts that can be fitted into a gun. Those firearms can\'t be detected by metal detectors or X-ray machines.\nThe senator says that means anyone can download a gun cheaply, then take the weapons anywhere, including high-security areas.\nMore than 100,000 copies of plans for the world\'s first 3D-printed handgun, The Liberator, were downloaded in May before the State Department told the Texas-based nonprofit behind the firearm to stop sharing the file.\nThe Philadelphia City Council voted unanimously last week to prohibit the use of 3-D printers to create any firearm or "any piece thereof" unless that person possesses a license to manufacture firearms, making Philly the first city in the U.S. to pass such a ban.\nIn May, Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., requested a plan of action from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on the new threat posed by guns made with 3-D printing technology. The senator said earlier this month he has yet to receive a response.\n“We must not allow a 3-D printer cartridge to become as deadly as a gun cartridge,” Markey said. “These homemade 3-D printed-guns are no longer a figment of the imagination but are a real threat to the public. We need to immediately pass the Undetectable Firearms Act to ensure these stealth weapons don’t go undetected."\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

SPRINGFIELD -- Lawmakers made Illinois the last state to allow concealed carry of firearms in two quick votes Tuesday that formalized the deepening rift between Gov. Pat Quinn and the legislature.\nThe House and Senate voted to override Quinn\'s amendatory veto of a legislative compromise aimed at satisfying a federal court deadline for legalizing some form of public possession of firearms. Illinois was the last state without some form of legal concealed carry, but the appeals court ruled late last year that the ban was unconstitutional.\nWhile Tuesday\'s court deadline for passing a law was a major motivating factor, the 77-31 House vote and 41-17 Senate roll call were more than a rejection of Quinn\'s efforts to toughen the regulations — they were a repudiation of the Democratic governor\'s leadership style by a Democratic-led legislature.\nQuinn, who has said he will seek a second elected term as governor next year, found Democrats assailing his lack of direct involvement in the legislative negotiations that led to the compromise bill that originally passed the General Assembly on May 31— the final day of the spring session.\n"It was all grandstanding and he should be ashamed of himself," said Rep. Brandon Phelps, the Harrisburg Democrat who sponsored the override.\n"He thumbed his nose at our compromise," said Phelps, who had accused Quinn of political pandering to voters supportive of tight gun control in Democratic-dominated Cook County. Phelps said the House and Senate votes send a "pretty strong message to the governor that he was wrong the whole time."\nThe complaints about Quinn\'s handling of the gun debate mirrored those from lawmakers on Illinois\' most vexing issue — the state\'s massive unfunded liability for public employee pensions. Lawmakers also blew through Quinn\'s Tuesday deadline for a special bipartisan panel to come up with a pension fix — something that has been elusive for the past two years.\n"Anyone who doesn\'t understand that we\'re going to run this bill over his objections doesn\'t understand government," Sen. Mike Jacobs, D-East Moline, said about the gun bill. He urged the governor not to make the same mistake on pensions: "I want Gov. Quinn to get in the game."\nQuinn had issued a blanket criticism of lawmakers — including gun control allies who supported the bill — as "genuflecting" to the National Rifle Association. Following the vote, he defended his efforts to work with lawmakers but said the General Assembly had "surrendered" to the NRA.\n"With respect to working and getting the job done, I think the people of Illinois know that I work every day for their common good. I believe in gun safety, and I\'m going to always speak out about that. I don\'t think people should have their lives and property harmed by people with loaded concealed weapons who don\'t, under the law, deserve to have them," he said.\nQuinn promised to continue seeking the changes he had proposed, including banning firearms from establishments that sell any alcohol, limiting a person to carrying one concealed firearm at a time, and restricting magazines for concealed weapons to no more than 10 rounds.\nThe governor was successful in peeling off some votes from gun control advocates. The measure originally got 89 House votes and 45 Senate votes. But faced with the prospect that the legislature\'s failure to enact a law could lead to unregulated concealed carry, even gun control supporters in the legislature urged an override of the governor.\nSen. Kwame Raoul, D-Chicago, who negotiated the measure on behalf of gun control advocates, said he felt conflicted by rejecting Quinn\'s changes because he originally sought to include many of them. He warned that voting with Quinn was a "political vote" but one that endangered public safety if no law was enacted.\n"There\'s no more time," Raoul said. "We are here on July 9th and if the members of this chamber have the interests of public safety at their heart, they would vote \'yes\' to override."\nIt will be several months before qualified gun owners can carry a concealed firearm outside their homes while the Illinois State Police puts together licensing procedures and applicant reviews.\nBut the legislature\'s decision to override Quinn and stick to its agreed-upon compromise may represent only a short-lived truce between gun rights advocates and gun control supporters in a state where there is a vast divergence over how firearms are viewed, dependent largely upon cultural and regional differences.\nEven a late effort by lawmakers to amend another bill to reflect three mostly minor changes that the governor had proposed ended up falling short of the votes needed in the House after first passing the Senate.\nPhelps acknowledged now that the law is in effect, "you\'re going to see political posturing on both sides of this issue."\nSen. Christine Radogno of Lemont, the Senate Republican leader, told colleagues that "I don\'t think this is the last time we\'re going to be discussing this issue." And Rep. Kelly Cassidy, D-Chicago, a gun control supporter, said "it is a very safe bet that we will be back" fighting over changes in the new law.\nCassidy noted the new law removes the ability of larger communities to set some of their own gun laws and said she feared gun rights supporters are "going to be back here time after time after time chipping away at all the things that everyone has lauded as the great protections."\nSen. Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, said lawmakers "can and should add more protections to when and how people can carry guns in public places. I believe in give-and-take and compromise, but we can\'t bargain away the safety of our families."\nRichard Pearson, who heads the Illinois State Rifle Association, cheered the vote of legislators to overcome Quinn\'s efforts to make the legislation more restrictive. But he also said that the new law was "not perfect" and that it would be reviewed and fine-tuned when necessary.\nThe governor, whose political roots were established by embracing populist causes, has found his grass-roots support on major issues tested as he faces a primary challenge next year from Bill Daley and, perhaps, Attorney General Lisa Madigan. Quinn maintained he has the support of Illinois residents in his quest to impose tougher gun regulations.\n"The people of Illinois are good and true and we are going to get the amendments I outlined," Quinn said. "We\'re going to have to fight ever harder to get them adopted one by one by this legislature because that\'s what makes common sense to the people of Illinois."

The tragic killing of Trayvon Martin and the initial decision by the police not to arrest George Zimmerman for that killing have focused public attention on Florida\'s "stand your ground" law.\nAccording to police, Zimmerman claims self-defense, but many observers can\'t understand how a grown man with a gun can plausibly claim that he was forced to kill a teenager armed only with some candy.\nIf that\'s the law of self-defense in Florida (and elsewhere), these observers argue, the law needs to change.\nThe law of self-defense is at its core about reasonableness. If a person reasonably perceives a serious threat of harm, and uses reasonable force to meet that threat, the law justifies even deadly force, and it does so even if it turns out that the perceived threat was illusory.\nPeople have differing views of what\'s reasonable and, as a consequence, self-defense laws (which vary by jurisdiction) have always attempted to further define the concept. Until very recently, Florida\'s definition of reasonableness, as in many states, incorporated a longstanding principle, the "duty to retreat."\nThis principle required that someone who found themselves in a violent confrontation had to try to defuse the situation and retreat "to the wall" before resorting to deadly force.\nThe "duty to retreat" also made it easier for prosecutors to prove that a killing was not in self-defense. The facts that can be proven are often murky (particularly when of the two people who know what happened, one is the defendant and the other is dead) and prosecutors could often, by pointing to a defendant\'s failure to retreat, obtain a conviction even without establishing the precise facts.\nIn American jurisdictions there has long been an exception to the duty to retreat called the "Castle Doctrine." As then-Judge (and later U.S. Supreme Court Justice) Benjamin Cardozo explained in 1914: "It is not now and never has been the law that a man assailed in his own dwelling is bound to retreat. If assailed there, he may stand his ground and resist the attack. He is under no duty to take to the fields and the highways, a fugitive from his own home."\nIn recent times, "stand your ground" laws extended this concept in many states beyond the home to any place where a person might lawfully be found, such as a bar or a public sidewalk. Florida\'s version enacted in 2005 (over the objection of many in law enforcement) is one of the most far reaching.\nThe law states that a person "who is attacked" anywhere he is lawfully present has "no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm."\nImportantly, a person cannot invoke this provision if he is "engaged in unlawful activity" or "initially provokes the use of force against himself." Finally, in Florida, once self-defense becomes an issue at trial, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense -- a heavy burden.\nThis is the legal backdrop against which Florida\'s prosecuting authorities must assess all claims of self-defense, including Zimmerman\'s. In an ideal world, law enforcement would make this assessment by thoroughly investigating the case and, after determining the provable facts, comparing those facts to the law.\nCritical to this determination will be evidence reflecting: how the confrontation began and how the suspect acted after the confrontation (prosecutors often look for actions such as flight or a cover-up that indicate a "consciousness of guilt"). Perhaps most critically, investigators will compare all the evidence (physical and otherwise) with the suspect\'s statement (if any) about what happened.\nIf the investigation reveals sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Zimmerman was not acting in self-defense (as Florida law defines that concept), he can be prosecuted. If not, charges are unwarranted.\nDepending on the facts that ultimately emerge, the "stand your ground" law may ultimately control the legal outcome of the Trayvon Martin case. If, as a result, Florida\'s citizens and legislators (and those in other states) see that law in a new light, they can change the law, perhaps leading to fewer tragic outcomes in the future.\nFor it may (as many suspect) be the case that Zimmerman was not forced to kill Trayvon Martin. But in a state like Florida with a "stand your ground" law, that is no longer the standard for determining whether someone acted lawfully in self-defense.

NEW YORK—New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the media need to improve their coverage of gun violence, arguing the press pays attention to gun-related deaths only after mass shootings.\nIn an interview with NBC’s Jimmy Fallon, Bloomberg called the Dec. 14 shooting that killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., “terribly tragic,” but said there is scant coverage of people who are killed by guns every day.\n“This was a crazy person with an assault weapon,” Bloomberg said of the Sandy Hook shooting. “But there’s 33 people killed in America with guns every single day of the year. And nobody seems to care. It only catches the press’s attention when it’s young kids concentrated. And it was terribly tragic, but there are kids killed every day all across this country.”\nBloomberg has emerged as one of the most vocal advocates of new gun-control measures since the Sandy Hook shooting, urging President Barack Obama to make the issue a top priority in his second term. But the mayor insisted he’s not trying to ban guns, telling Fallon that “if you are responsible and you are adult and you don’t have a criminal record, there’s nothing wrong with you having a gun.”\nThe problem, Bloomberg said, is that Congress doesn’t “fund enforcement” of existing gun laws and “guns are getting into the hands of the wrong people.”\n“There’s just too many guns in the world and certainly in this country,” Bloomberg said. “And we’ve just got to do something about it.”\nThe mayor discussed his meeting Wednesday with former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot at point-blank range and nearly killed during a constituent meeting two years ago. Giffords, who is set to visit Newtown today, resigned from Congress to focus on recovery.\n“She's still recovering. She’s still doing therapy and yoga and struggling to learn to speak again. … And she’s lucky. She lived,” Bloomberg said.

In the early hours on Thursday, CT passed a new comprehensive bipartisan gun responsibility law.\nInteresting read from AP:\nHow Conn. Gun Bill Compares to New NY, Colo. Laws\nGun control measures proposed in Connecticut after the December massacre in Newtown and expected to win approval Wednesday would be among the strongest such laws in the country. Here is a look at how the proposals compare to laws passed this year in Colorado and New York:\nPBS:\nConnecticut legislators are expected to pass sweeping gun-control legislation on Wednesday, becoming the third state since the Dec. 14 shooting in Newtown to do so.\nBut until recently, it wasn’t clear whether any legislation would even come to a vote. Connecticut has several strict gun laws in place — it was one of the few to pass a state assault weapons ban in 1993. But in recent years, the state’s pro-gun groups, using grassroots and legislative pressure, have killed two major pieces of gun-control legislation in a coordinated offensive. They strongly opposed any new laws after Newtown.\nThis time, though, something was different.\nLocal residents in support of gun-control began turning up at hearings that were once largely attended by gun advocates.\nEmpty threats made by the gun lobby. They were ignored by CT legislators.\nBut from beginning to end, the victims were never far away. Around 12:40 a.m. Mitch Bolinsky, a freshman Republican who has been elected from Newtown a month before the tragedy, rose to speak.\n"On Dec. 14, evil visited my town and everything changed,” he said. He cited the strength he’d seen in Newtown, the compassion shown for the town, the painful journey everyone had been through and read the names of those who died at the school. He said the legislation was not perfect, especially on mental health but said his constituents overwhelming supported the firearms provisions and as a result he would vote in favor of the bill.\n"I dedicate my vote to the memory of those whose lives were lost at Sandy Hook Elementary School,” he said.\nMore politics and policy below the fold, including a new gun responsibility poll from Quinnipiac.\n"In every Quinnipiac University poll since the Newtown massacre, nationally and in six states, we find overwhelming support, including among gun owners, for universal background checks," said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. "American voters agree with the National Rifle Association, however, that these background checks could lead someday to confiscation of legally-owned guns."\n"The question is how many of these voters fear confiscation as an abuse of government power and how many are hoping the government uses confiscation to get more guns off the street," Brown added.\nExpecting gun confiscation are Republicans 61 - 25 percent and independent voters 51 - 36 percent, while Democrats say 54 - 32 percent there will not be confiscation. Men say confiscation is likely 52 - 37 percent and women agree 45 - 38 percent.\nDespite that, background checks are supported 91-8.\nBut Scott Wilson, president of the Connecticut Citizens Defense League, said nothing in the new legislation would stop someone like Adam Lanza, the 20-year-old gunman.\n"In his case, he stole the guns and went on a murderous rampage. Limiting magazine capacity or mandating registration will only affect law-abiding persons, not criminals bent on murder," Wilson added.\nThe Connecticut Citizen Defense League? Yeah, these guys.\nWith Congress set to debate the emerging plan to expand background checks, conservatives and Republicans — and even a few red state Democrats — continue to traffic heavily in deliberate misdirection and distortions about the proposal. They are getting widespread media play and are dominating the debate.\nSo I asked Daniel Webster, a leading expert on gun violence who is the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, to respond to many of their arguments. Footnotes are at the end.\nand Greg Sargent:\nRepublican Senators (and too many red state Dems) have fallen into line behind the NRA’s lurid claims not just about the [UN international arms trafficking] treaty, but also about gun control, endorsing its paranoid and false claim that expanding background checks would create a national gun registry. With United States Senators eagerly feeding such fringe views rather than engaging in genuine policy debate, is it any wonder that it’s a major struggle to implement even the most modest and sensible effort to limit the ongoing murder of innocents, one that is supported by nine in 10 Americans?\nAnd what\'s up with sports figures and their own rules? NY Times:\nWith the business of college sports becoming more crucial to a university’s prominence — not to mention its bottom line — the choice of Mr. Pernetti seemed to pay off. Sports at Rutgers were on the rise and, last November, the university received a coveted invitation to join the Big Ten, an athletic conference that guaranteed vast exposure and huge television revenue.\nBut now, with outrage growing over the abusive behavior of Mike Rice — the university’s men’s basketball coach — Mr. Pernetti and the university’s president, Robert L. Barchi, find themselves under scrutiny for their handling of the case. Their jobs may be in jeopardy, and their university is once again attracting unflattering attention just two years after Tyler Clementi, an 18-year-old gay student, killed himself after a bullying incident.

Gun stocks rose Wednesday, even as President Obama called on Congress to pass an assault weapon ban.\nThe stock prices for Smith & Wesson Holding Co. (SWHC) and Sturm, Ruger & Co. (RGR) rose about 4%. The stock for Sturm, Ruger has risen 13% in the month since the shooting at a Newtown, Conn., elementary school that left 20 children and six educators dead.\nRetailers that specialize in guns have also done well. The stock price for Cabela\'s (CAB) surged 6% on Wednesday and has gained 20% over the last month. Dick\'s Sporting Goods (DKS) notched up slightly, and has gained 6% over the month.\nObama issued the call for the assault ban as part of a broad response to the Newtown shooting.\n"Congress should restore the ban on military style assault weapons and a 10-round limit for magazines," the president said. Obama was referring to a 10-year ban that expired in 2004, which limited the capacity of magazines and restricted military-style features on semiautomatic rifles.\nBut the specter of a potential ban in the wake of mass shootings around the country has prompted gun enthusiasts to stock up on the weapons that may some day be denied to them.\n"Consumers are flocking to stores to purchase certain types of firearms, including assault rifles, in fears of some type of ban going forward," said Rommel Dionisio, gun industry analyst for Wedbush Securities. "It\'s people rushing to buy them before they\'re banned."\nDick\'s said last month that it has suspended sales of assault rifles.\nSmith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger manufacture a wide variety of firearms, including the semiautomatic rifles that are known various as assault weapons or modern sporting rifles.\nThere are many other non-public companies that manufacture semiautomatic rifles, including Bushmaster Firearms International, which makes the rifle used at the Newtown shooting and also a recent shooting in Webster, N.Y., where a convict burned down houses and then ambushed and killed two volunteer firefighters.\nSuch a ban, if it passes, would also impact manufacturers of high-capacity magazines. They include the Beta Company, which makes 100-round drums, and SGM Tactical, which produces 30-round and 100-round magazines.\nHigh-capacity magazines face a potential ban because they were used by Adam Lanza in the Newtown shooting and by James Holmes, suspect in a mass shooting last year at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.\nObama acknowledged that he faces serious opposition in trying to get an assault weapon bill passed by a Republican-controlled House.\nEven as Obama spoke, thousands of gun industry members packed into the SHOT Show -- an annual trade show -- in Las Vegas. The show is owned and sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an organization based in Newtown, less than two miles from the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting.

We usually cringe when politicians drag ordinary people onstage for their events. But the four children who appeared with their parents and President Obama in the White House on Wednesday at his announcement on gun control proposals drove home the nature of the crisis facing the country. While guns and gun control have been a subject of debate among politicians and lawyers and lobbyists and pollsters and political groups in the center and on the fringes, our children have been living in a free-fire zone for sociopaths with virtually unfettered access to instruments of mass murder.\nIt is past time that elected leaders did something about it without worrying, as Mr. Obama said on Wednesday, about getting “an A grade from the gun lobby.” It has been a bipartisan betrayal of the public’s safety, the fault of Democrats and Republicans, and of a string of presidents who have said mournful things after the mass murders at Columbine and Virginia Tech and Aurora and Newtown but did not act.\nWednesday was the exception. One month after the Newtown, Conn., murders, Mr. Obama presented a comprehensive set of initiatives that was, for a change, structured around what needs to be done and not what political tacticians think the president could get a dysfunctional Congress to pass. Mr. Obama can be frustrating at moments like this, and his delivery today was as professorial as ever. But he stepped up to the broader issue before the nation in remembering the tragedy at Newtown.\n“While there is no law or set of laws that can prevent every senseless act of violence completely, no piece of legislation that will prevent every tragedy, every act of evil,” he said, “if there is even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there’s even one life that can be saved, then we’ve got an obligation to try.”\n•\nMr. Obama said he believes the Second Amendment bestows an individual right to own guns. We have disagreed with that position, but it is now the law as judged by the Supreme Court, and as Mr. Obama said so passionately, it should be no impediment to gun regulation.\n“Along with our freedom to live our lives as we will comes an obligation to allow others to do the same,” Mr. Obama said, noting that 900 people have died in gun violence since Newtown, a vast majority of them on the streets of “big cities and small towns.”\nWe have “the right to worship freely and safely; that right was denied to Sikhs in Oak Creek, Wis.,” Mr. Obama said. “The right to assemble peaceably; that right was denied shoppers in Clackamas, Ore., and moviegoers in Aurora, Colo. That most fundamental set of rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, fundamental rights that were denied to college students at Virginia Tech and high school students at Columbine and elementary school students in Newtown; and kids on street corners in Chicago on too frequent a basis to tolerate.”\nMr. Obama’s announcement was preceded by a blast of propaganda from the far right that his proposals would be confiscatory and tyrannical. Anyone who was paying attention to the news in the last couple of weeks knew that this was nonsense, and the proposals announced on Wednesday were not remotely similar to what the gun lobby wanted Americans to believe they would be. They will not limit any law-abiding American’s right to own guns for hunting, or sport, or collection, or self-protection.\nThe package is a mix of executive orders intended to tighten and heighten enforcement of existing gun laws and sweep away ideologically motivated restrictions on government action against gun violence, and new laws that will have to be passed by Congress.\n•\nMr. Obama’s bills would require universal criminal background checks for all gun sales, doing away with the loopholes for gun shows, private sales and Internet sales that have exempted 40 percent of all gun sales from those checks. He called on Congress to reinstate and toughen the ban on assault weapons that was allowed to expire in 2004. He wants to restore a 10-round limit on ammunition magazines and to ban armor-piercing bullets that are used by criminals to kill police officers. The president asked Congress to pass a $4 billion measure intended to retain 15,000 police officers who are being laid off as states and localities react to the recent recession and to budget cuts from Washington.\nMr. Obama also issued executive orders to make the background checks system more comprehensive and strengthen enforcement of existing gun laws. He is ending a freeze on research into gun violence at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was imposed by lawmakers at the behest of a gun lobby that is terrified by the prospect that gun violence could be viewed, as it should be, as a public health issue. He also signed an order making it clear that doctors and other health care providers are not prohibited by any federal law from reporting their patients’ threats of violence and that the health care reform law “does not prevent doctors from talking to patients about gun safety.”\nMr. Obama and Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. acknowledged that getting any of the president’s proposals through Congress was going to be a herculean task. Mr. Biden said, “I also have never seen the nation’s conscience so shaken by what happened” in Newtown. We have hoped, too, that the murders last month would finally inspire action, especially if Americans pressured their representatives in Congress to do something about this crisis.\nMr. Obama and Mr. Biden will have to make good on Mr. Obama’s promise to do everything they can to fight for these proposals in Congress — and that will mean twisting arms and making threats to members of his own party as well as to Republicans.\nThe gun lobby is focused within the Republican Party, but Democratic lawmakers have also been to blame for failing to pass meaningful gun regulations. Already, some Democrats who should be strongest on gun controls are showing familiar signs of weakness.\nSenator Pat Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, will be needed as a leader in this effort but has been mumbling about the need to hold extensive hearings. And Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, was making ominous, cowardly remarks over the weekend about tailoring whatever the Senate does to what he thinks could get through a House dominated by the far-right fringe of the Republican Party. He has started to wriggle away from the idea of an assault weapons ban, for example.\nThis is not a time for lawmakers to do the politically safe thing or the N.R.A.-approved thing, even if they know it is less than needed. It is time to reach for big ideas and strong laws on gun violence.\n•\nThis is part of a continuing series on the epidemic of gun violence and possible solutions.

NEW YORK—West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said Tuesday he\'s optimistic that a revised bipartisan bill to expand background checks for gun sales will pass the Senate.\n"We really need five votes," Manchin, a Democrat, said during an interview at the Atlantic\'s New York Ideas Festival. The original bill, which Manchin co-sponsored with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, failed in a 54-46 Senate vote last month.\nA new bill, Manchin said, is in the works. "Oh, it\'s coming back," he said.\nManchin said he needs to educate law-abiding gun owners who support the legislation but don\'t trust the government.\n"The big problem is that they\'re afraid that this is the first step because they\'ve seen overreach," he said.\nThe background check bill, Manchin said, not only protects Second Amendment rights, but expands them.\nOther detractors said the bill might infringe on gun transfers between family members. "It doesn\'t at all," Manchin said.\nThe Democratic senator also scoffed at talk of the "culture war" discussed at the National Rifle Association convention in Houston over the weekend as cage-rattling rhetoric.\n"What you saw was the division that\'s going on across the country," Manchin, a gun owner and member of the NRA, said. "I don\'t know why we can\'t sit and talk and work together as Americans."\nManchin said the school shootings in Newtown, Conn., affected his views.\n"If Newtown didn\'t change you, nothing will," Manchin said. "It made you think, \'Can we do something a little better?\'"\nTwenty-six people, including 20 children, were killed in the Dec. 14, 2012, shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\nManchin added: "None of those families came to my office and asked to repeal the Second Amendment." They asked him to make it harder for people who are bent on killing to get guns.\n"That was a small ask," he said.

Obama was referring to a 10-year ban that expired in 2004, which limited the capacity of magazines and restricted military-style features on semiautomatic rifles.\nBut the specter of a potential ban in the wake of mass shootings around the country has prompted gun enthusiasts to stock up on the weapons that may some day be denied to them.\n"Consumers are flocking to stores to purchase certain types of firearms, including assault rifles, in fears of some type of ban going forward," said Rommel Dionisio, gun industry analyst for Wedbush Securities. "It\'s people rushing to buy them before they\'re banned."\nDick\'s said last month that it has suspended sales of assault rifles.\nSmith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger manufacture a wide variety of firearms, including the semiautomatic rifles that are known various as assault weapons or modern sporting rifles.\nThere are many other non-public companies that manufacture semiautomatic rifles, including Bushmaster Firearms International, which makes the rifle used at the Newtown shooting and also a recent shooting in Webster, N.Y., where a convict burned down houses and then ambushed and killed two volunteer firefighters.\nSuch a ban, if it passes, would also impact manufacturers of high-capacity magazines. They include the Beta Company, which makes 100-round drums, and SGM Tactical, which produces 30-round and 100-round magazines.\nHigh-capacity magazines face a potential ban because they were used by Adam Lanza in the Newtown shooting and by James Holmes, suspect in a mass shooting last year at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.\nObama acknowledged that he faces serious opposition in trying to get an assault weapon bill passed by a Republican-controlled House.\nEven as Obama spoke, thousands of gun industry members packed into the SHOT Show -- an annual trade show -- in Las Vegas. The show is owned and sponsored by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an organization based in Newtown, less than two miles from the site of the Sandy Hook school shooting.

MERIDEN/NEWTOWN, Connecticut (Reuters) - The gunman who killed 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school fired 154 rounds in less than 5 minutes, selecting high capacity magazines from a home arsenal stocked with swords, knives and a cache of guns, officials said.\nThe home of Nancy Lanza and her son Adam in Newtown Connecticut on March 28, 2013. Adam Lanza, the gunman who killed 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school fired 154 rounds in less than 5 minutes, selecting high capacity magazines from a home arsenal stocked with swords, knives and a cache of guns, officials said. REUTERS/ Michelle McLoughlin\nInvestigators also found a newspaper clipping about a mass shooting in the home that Adam Lanza shared with his mother, along with a gun safe in his bedroom, receipts from shooting ranges and National Rifle Association certificates for both of them, according to court papers released on Thursday.\nTo carry out the second deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, Lanza used 30-round magazines at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, said Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy after the previously sealed searches of Lanza’s car and home were made public.\n“We now know that he left the lower capacity magazines at home,” Malloy said in a statement. “This is exactly why we need to ban high capacity magazines and why we need to tighten our assault weapons ban.”\nAs more details about the shooting came to light, President Barack Obama urged with U.S. lawmakers not to forget those shot to death in Newtown three months ago.\n“The entire country pledged we would do something about it and that this time would be different. Shame on us if we’ve forgotten,” said Obama, appearing at the White House with mothers of children who had been shot to death.\nThe December 14 rampage started at the Lanza family home, where authorities say the 20-year-old shot dead his mother, Nancy Lanza, and then drove to the school he once attended. Armed with an AR-15-type assault rifle and two handguns he killed the 20 children, six staff members and himself.\nThe pale yellow two-story suburban colonial house where Lanza lived is directly across the street from the home of Dylan Hockley, 6, who died in his teacher’s arms in the massacre. The Hockley family has since moved to another part of town.\nSearches of the house by police turned up a cache of guns, three samurai-style swords and boxes of bullets, along with items that could offer some clues on Adam Lanza’s thinking.\nAmong them were a 2008 New York Times clipping on an Illinois school shooting and books on Asperger’s syndrome and autism. Friends of the Lanza family had described Adam Lanza as having Asperger’s syndrome, which is a form of autism.\nFor some in the tight-knit southern New England town, the release of the new details only inflamed emotional wounds.\n“We struggle every day to stay on the path of recovery and every bit of information that becomes part of the public discourse holds a potential hurt for a family who has already suffered immeasurable harm,” said Newtown First Selectman E. Patricia Llodra.\nThe attack, which Obama called the worst day of his presidency, reignited a fierce debate on gun violence and gun regulation in the United States. The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to gun ownership.\nThe National Rifle Association called after the shooting for armed guards to patrol public schools, while gun-control advocates called for tighter restrictions on both the process to buy guns and the types of guns and ammunition clips that may be sold.\nTHE CACHE OF WEAPONS\nThe court papers said police searching the Lanza home found an Enfield bolt-action rifle, a Savage Mark II rifle, a revolver, three samurai-style swords with blades measuring up to 28 inches and a 6-foot, 10-inch wood-handled pole with a blade on one side and a spear on the other.\nThey also found a smashed computer hard drive and a gun safe in the room they believed to be Adam Lanza’s bedroom; NRA certificates in the names of both Adam Lanza and his mother; and Nancy Lanza’s body in her bed with a gunshot wound to her forehead and a rifle on the floor nearby.\nFBI agents interviewed one or more people who described Lanza as “a shut-in and avid (video) gamer who plays Call of Duty amongst other games.” It was noted that the Sandy Hook Elementary School was his “life.”\nMayors Against Illegal Guns on Thursday released a TV ad featuring family members of the victims calling for tighter control of guns. Broadcast in Hartford, Connecticut, it was aimed to encourage a proposed Connecticut gun-control law.\n“We cannot afford to wait for another tragedy,” said New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the group’s co-chairman.\nThe investigation documents were released on the same day as hundreds of protesters demonstrated at the National Shooting Sports Foundation, less than 3 miles from the school, over the NRA’s opposition to new gun control laws. Newtown residents were enraged after receiving a slew of robo-calls on behalf of the NRA that were critical of gun control laws.\nCaithlin De Marrais, a 40-year-old musician from Easton, Connecticut, who brought along her 7-month-old baby, carried a handmade sign proclaiming “Enough.”\n“I’m here to support Newtown and all the communities that have lost loved ones due to gun violence,” she said.\nThe crowd also included those who oppose more gun control, among them Tahra Erickson, 33, who stood with her three-year-old son Zachary.\n“I don’t think it’s the government’s job to tell me how I can protect my son,” she said.

One of the most powerful pieces of feature journalism I’ve read in a long time is on the front-page of Sunday’s New York Times. It’s the first chapter in a series by Mike McIntire--who’s now obviously on a beeline to the annual Pulitzer finals--on “the gun industry\'s influence and the wide availability of firearms in America,” titled: “Selling a New Generation on Guns.” I’ll get to this “must-read” in a few paragraphs, but I’m going to “get a little tangential” first.\nQuestion: If there’s a national protest against gun violence, and it’s not covered on Daily Kos, does that mean it doesn’t matter?\nI’ve got to ask: What’s going on here?\nUnless I’m missing something (and I hope I have), there wasn’t a single mention (please, tell me this isn’t so, and I’ll remove this section of this post) in this community regarding THIS national story, yesterday: Co-sponsored by the Washington Arena Stage and “One Million Moms for Gun Control,” thousands of protestors against gun violence filled Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C.; and according to Reuters, “…One Million Moms organized similar events on Saturday in about a dozen cities, including San Francisco and Austin, Texas.”\n(Clarification, as noted in the comments, down below: This is “One Million Moms for Gun Control,” and it\'s NOT affiliated with an anti-LGBT group with a similar name.)\nWASHINGTON | Sat Jan 26, 2013 9:37pm EST\n(Reuters) - Thousands of marchers rallied in Washington in favor of gun control on Saturday, including residents of Newtown, Connecticut, where a mass elementary school shooting reignited the U.S. gun violence debate.\nSpeakers - including Education Secretary Arne Duncan, lawmakers and actors - urged the protesters carrying such signs as "What Would Jesus Pack?" to lobby Congress and state legislators to back gun control measures…\n…\n"…This is about gun responsibility. This is about gun safety. This is about fewer dead Americans, fewer dead children, fewer children living in fear," Duncan said.\nOrganizers backed President Barack Obama\'s call for a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines and background checks for all gun sales. They also urged safety training for all buyers of firearms.\nMarchers stretched for several blocks along Constitution Avenue as they approached the rally site in the shadow of the Washington Monument…\nElsewhere in Washington, less than 48 hours earlier, as fellow Kossack Meteor Blades informed us: “Sen. Feinstein\'s assault weapons ban will face stiff resistance from some elected Democrats.”\nAs One Million Moms’ protestor Amy Journo, a Newtown, CT resident with two sons, five and seven years old, who attended Sandy Hook Elementary School, noted in the Reuters story (linked and excerpted above):\n"It\'s difficult to get laws changed when politicians are bought out, but we have to start somewhere…I want to ensure that they (children) are safer, not just my children but all across the United States."\nAnd, this quote brings us (back) full-circle to Mike McIntire’s stunning feature story in Sunday’s NY Times.\nAs you’ll learn in the article--god forbid, if anyone was ever going to walk into an elementary school classroom with an assault weapon again—if the Newtown, CT-based National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) has their way, eight-year-olds throughout America will be fully proficient with firearms, up to and including semi-automatic assault weapons; and, they’ll have the knowledge and skills necessary to take the shooter out!\nI mean, “seriously!” Why waste taxpayer money on training educators how to handle guns, when you may accomplish the same end result by encouraging the parents of students in the second grade to pay for their kids to learn how to handle AR-15s and semi-automatic pistols, instead?\nApparently, as we learn in today’s NYT, this is the logic behind the NSSF’s “First Shots” program. And then, as it’s explained in Mike McIntire’s piece, you’ll learn more about folks like, “Larry Potterfield, the founder of MidwayUSA, one of the nation’s largest sellers of shooting supplies… who said his own children started shooting ‘boys’ rifles’ at age 4, getting young people engaged with firearms — provided they have the maturity and the physical ability to handle them — strengthens an endangered American tradition.”\nYou’ll also read about “Junior Shooters, an industry-supported magazine that seeks to get children involved in the recreational use of firearms, once featured a smiling 15-year-old girl clutching a semiautomatic rifle. At the end of an accompanying article that extolled target shooting with a Bushmaster AR-15 — an advertisement elsewhere in the magazine directed readers to a coupon for buying one — the author encouraged youngsters to share the article with a parent.”\n“Who knows?” it said. “Maybe you’ll find a Bushmaster AR-15 under your tree some frosty Christmas morning!”\nAnd, then there’s this gem from Junior Shooters’ editor Andy Fink, who…\n… acknowledged in an editorial that some of his magazine’s content stirred controversy.\n“I have heard people say, even shooters that participate in some of the shotgun shooting sports, such things as, ‘Why do you need a semiautomatic gun for hunting?’ ” he wrote. But if the industry is to survive, he said, gun enthusiasts must embrace all youth shooting activities, including ones “using semiautomatic firearms with magazines holding 30-100 rounds.”\nIn an interview, Mr. Fink elaborated. Semiautomatic firearms are actually not weapons, he said, unless someone chooses to hurt another person with them, and their image has been unfairly tainted by the news media. There is no legitimate reason children should not learn to safely use an AR-15 for recreation, he said.\n(Bold type is diarist’s emphasis.)\nYou really need to read McIntire’s entire article to get a sense of the truly savage, capitalistic nature of the matter.\nIn the meantime, speaking of capitalism and money, here’s the link to make a donation to “One Million Moms for Gun Control!”

Gun control rallies were held in dozens of states Thursday in an effort to energize the cause as prosecutors in Connecticut released chilling details of their investigation into the tragedy in Newtown. But according to a poll released this week, there has been a drop in support for stricter gun laws since the days immediately following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. NBC\'s Stephanie Gosk reports.\nPresident Barack Obama on Thursday sternly rebuked opponents of pending gun control measures, accusing them of “running out the clock” and hoping that the nation forgets last year’s Newtown school shooting in order to keep popular reforms from passing into law.\n“The entire country was shocked, and the entire country pledged we would do something about it and that that this time would be different," the president said of the gun massacre that killed 20 children and six adults. “Shame on us if we’ve forgotten.”\nFlanked by Vice President Joe Biden and a group of mothers who have lost their children to gun violence, Obama accused gun rights groups of rooting for amnesia.\nPresident Barack Obama delivers remarks Thursday at the White House regarding gun reform in America.\n“The reason we’re talking about it here today is because it’s not done until it’s done,” he said. “And there are some powerful voices on the other side that are interested in running out the clock or changing the subject or drowning out the majority of the American people to prevent any of these reforms from happening at all. They’re doing everything they can to make all our progress collapse under the weight of fear and frustration or their assumption is that people will just forget about it.”\nObama\'s remarks came on the same day that authorities released new information about Newtown shooter Adam Lanza, including the list of guns and ammunition that he stockpiled for the attack. Lanza fired 154 bullets from a Bushmaster .223 caliber model XM15 rifle, the documents said.\nCiting poll numbers that show broad support – as high as 90 percent in some polls -- for universal background checks, the president urged voters to “make yourself unmistakenly heard” to members of Congress in the days before the Senate takes up gun legislation next month.\n“I ask every American to find out where your member of Congress stands on these ideas,” he said. “If they’re not part of that 90% who agree that we should make it harder for a criminal or somebody with a severe mental illness to buy a gun, then you should ask them why not.”\nThe legislation working its way through the Senate has hit numerous snags, with the threat of a filibuster now looming from lawmakers who say the president’s framework would restrict Second Amendment rights.\n“The proposals the president is calling for Congress to pass would primarily serve to reduce the constitutionally protected rights of law-abiding citizens while having little or no effect on violent crime,” said Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, one of the Republicans who has pledged to block the legislation. “It is deeply unfortunate that he continues to use the tragedy at Newtown as a backdrop for pushing legislation that would have done nothing to prevent that horrible crime.”\nA nation mourns after the second deadliest school shooting in U.S. history left 20 children and six staff members dead at Sandy Hook Elementary.\nA federal assault weapons ban has already been dropped from the overall gun package that Senate lawmakers plan to introduce after the Easter recess, although advocates are pushing for a separate vote on the measure. (Obama did not specifically mention the ban in his remarks Thursday, focusing instead on the more politically palatable planks of the effort.)\nAnd negotiators are still tussling over compromise language to require all gun buyers to complete a background check – a measure that need take significant Republican support to overcome the threat of a filibuster.\nIn recent weeks, Vice President Joe Biden has been the administration’s public point man on the gun issue, appearing with victims of violence and alongside gun control advocate new York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to appeal for “courage” from Congress.\nOn a conference call with gun control supporters yesterday, Biden said the coming efforts are “just the beginning” of a public outcry to reduce gun violence.\n“I think we’re on the verge of getting a serious, thorough universal background check system in place and it will — emphasize, it will — it will save lives,” Biden said.\nBloomberg has led the money charge, pledging to spend millions of his considerable fortune to pressure wavering lawmakers into supporting gun control proposals.\n“If 90 percent of the public want something, and their representatives vote against that, common sense says, they are going to have a price to pay for that,” the New York City mayor said during an interview with NBC’s Meet the Press last weekend\nPopular Discussio

HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Connecticut lawmakers announced a deal Monday on what they called some of the toughest gun laws in the country that were proposed after the December mass shooting in the state, including a ban on new high-capacity ammunition magazines like the ones used in the massacre that left 20 children and six educators dead.\nThe proposal includes new registration requirements for existing magazines that carry 10 or more bullets, something of a disappointment for some family members of Newtown victims who wanted an outright ban on the possession of all high-capacity magazines and traveled to the state Capitol on Monday to ask lawmakers for it.\nThe package also creates what lawmakers said is the nation\'s first statewide dangerous weapon offender registry, creates a new "ammunition eligibility certificate," imposes immediate universal background checks for all firearms sales, and extends the state\'s assault weapons ban to 100 new types of firearms and requires that a weapon have only one of several features in order to be banned.\nThe newly banned weapons could no longer be bought or sold in Connecticut, and those legally owned already would have to be registered with the state, just like the high-capacity magazines.\n"No gun owner will lose their gun," said House Minority Leader Lawrence Cafero Jr., a Norwalk Republican. "No gun owner will lose their magazines."\nThe bill also addresses mental health and school security measures.\nThe shooting Dec. 14 at Sandy Hook Elementary School reignited the gun debate in the country and led to calls for increased gun control legislation on the federal and state levels. While some other states, including neighboring New York, have strengthened their gun laws, momentum has stalled in Congress, whose members were urged by President Barack Obama last week not to forget the shooting and to capitalize on the best chance in years to stem gun violence.\nConnecticut should be seen as an example for lawmakers elsewhere, said Senate President Donald E. Williams Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat.

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - President Barack Obama pressed Congress on Monday to at least hold a vote on banning assault weapons, the most contentious part of his plan to curb gun violence in the United States.\nA police officer's gun sits in its holster as U.S. President Barack Obama speaks about ways to reduce gun violence during a visit to the Minneapolis Police Department Special Operations Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota February 4, 2013. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS CRIME LAW)\nObama’s comments suggested a realization in the White House that it will be difficult to get such a ban passed by lawmakers, despite consistent public support for the measure.\nOpposition is high in Congress, including among some Democrats, and by calling simply for a vote, Obama seemed to acknowledge that even getting that far - let alone having an assault weapons ban approved - would be a struggle.\n“We should restore the ban on military style assault weapons and a 10-round limit for magazines. And that deserves a vote in Congress, because weapons of war have no place on our streets,” Obama said as uniformed law enforcement officers stood behind him at the Minneapolis Police Department’s Special Operation Center.\nIt was Obama’s first trip outside Washington to promote gun control since he announced a package that includes calls for universal background checks and 10-round limits on ammunition magazines.\n“No law or set of laws can keep our children completely safe. But if there’s even one thing we can do, if there’s just one life we can save, we’ve got an obligation to try,” Obama said.\nWith a busy agenda that includes immigration reform and climate change, Obama hopes to move quickly on gun control before memories fade of December’s shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 20 children and six adults.\nA vote in Congress on the assault weapons ban might be held separately from other gun control measures.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein has said Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid promised that even if the ban is left out of a broader package to curb gun violence, she will have the opportunity to offer it as an amendment on the Senate floor.\nGun control efforts face an uphill battle against a powerful pro-gun lobby and a strong U.S. tradition of hunting and gun ownership. The right to bear arms is guaranteed to Americans in the U.S. Constitution.\nObama noted that support was widespread for universal background checks before guns are sold and indicated that he would press especially hard for that part of his proposals.\n“The vast majority of Americans - including a majority of gun owners - support requiring criminal background checks for anyone trying to buy a gun,” he said.\n“So right now, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are working on a bill that would ban anyone from selling a gun to somebody legally prohibited from owning one. That’s common sense. There’s no reason we can’t get that done.”\nObama urged legislators to name a permanent director for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, a post that has been vacant for years.\nMINNESOTA EXAMPLE\nMinnesota is emblematic of the challenges Obama will face in advancing gun control in Congress.\nWhile the state’s two Democratic U.S. senators have said they are sympathetic to measures to curb gun violence, the National Rifle Association, the largest U.S. gun-rights group, is influential in the state.\nIt has backed all four Republicans and two of the Democrats who represent Minnesota in the House of Representatives, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics.\nBut Minneapolis has a tradition of gun control. The city took steps in the mid-2000s to reduce incidents involving guns and juveniles after an outbreak of violent crimes.\nSlideshow (16 Images)\nOn the way to Monday’s event, Obama’s motorcade passed a man holding a sign that read, “Ban private ownership of military weapons.”\nThe Newtown massacre mobilized support for measures to contain access to certain guns and ammunition.\nThe Obama administration has included access to mental health and an examination of the effects of violent video games as part of its efforts to stem gun violence.\nGun-control efforts have foundered in the past despite strong public support, in part because many gun owners believe advocates of gun control oppose owning and using firearms in general.

Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, testified before a Senate hearing Tuesday that so-called "stand your ground" laws demand clarity.\nTwo Florida mothers whose unarmed sons were shot to death gave emotional testimony Tuesday at a Senate panel, demanding that states alter their "stand your ground" laws.\nSybrina Fulton described how the family had just celebrated her son Trayvon Martin\'s 17th birthday three weeks before he was killed in the Retreat at Twin Lakes, a gated community in Sanford, Fla.\n"He was simply going to get a drink and some candy. That tells me right there, his mentality. That tells me that he was not going to get cigarettes or bullets or condoms or other items of that nature," she told a packed Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. "Trayvon was minding his own business."\n"So I just wanted to come here to talk to you for a moment to let you know how important it is that we amend this stand-your-ground because it did not work in my case. The person that shot and killed my son is walking the streets today, and this law does not work. We need to seriously take a look at this law," she said.\nStand-your-ground laws are on the books in at least 22 states and change the legal definition of self-defense for citizens who feel they are being confronted with deadly force or imminent danger, canceling their duty to retreat. But Fulton argued at the hearing that the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting of her son and the acquittal of George Zimmerman over the summer shows that the laws are confusing.\nAlso testifying was Lucia Holman McBath, who wore a pin with a photo of her only child, Jordan Russell Davis, affixed to her chest.\nLucy McBath says the man that shot and killed her son was empowered by the Stand Your Ground statue adding, "I am here to tell you that there was no ground to stand, there was no threat."\nDavis, 17, was killed nearly a year ago when Michael David Dunn, 46, allegedly fired nine rounds on a Dodge Durango with four teenagers inside in Jacksonville, Fla., after complaining about their loud music and claiming he saw a gun. Authorities never found a gun inside.\nMcBath, struggling to hold back tears at one point, told the committee that Dunn sprayed the vehicle with bullets, then went back to his hotel and ordered a pizza. She said he wasn\'t arrested until the following morning.\n"That man was empowered by the \'stand your ground\' statute," McBath said. "I am here to tell you there was no ground to stand. There was no threat. No one was trying to invade his home, his vehicle, nor threatened him or his family."\nDunn\'s trial has been delayed until next year, but McBath said she faces the "very real possibility that my son\'s killer will walk free, hiding behind a statute that lets people claim a threat where there was none."\n"Even the Wild West had more stringent laws governing the taking of life than we have now. Stand-your-ground defies all reason. It goes against the sound system of justice established long ago on this very hill," she said.\nMcBath described her son to the committee: "I can tell you all about him. His easy smile, his first girlfriend, and his plans to join the Marines."\n"But you can never really know my boy because an angry man who owned a gun kept it close at hand and chose to demonstrate unbridled hatred one balmy evening for reasons I will never understand," she said.\nFlorida had the first stand-your-ground law, passed in 2005.\n"Trayvon and Jordan didn\'t ask to be martyrs. The American legal system made them martyrs," Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, said at the hearing. "Stand-your-ground laws eliminate all responsibility to retreat and peacefully end an incident."\nSen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., led the inquiry, calling two panels of witnesses to the hearing room on Tuesday to discuss the issue. The Senate is holding the hearing even though no congressional action is expected on the state policies, according to the AP.\nIn opening the hearing on Tuesday, Durbin said, "It is clearly time for stand-your-ground to be carefully reviewed."\n"These stand-your-ground laws have led to increases in homicides and firearms injuries," he said. "These stand-your-ground laws have allowed shooters to walk free in shocking situations."\nOn the other side of the discussion was Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who questioned what role federal government had in interfering with a state issue.\n"Self-defense is a bedrock liberty of every American, and I would note this is not a new concept," he said, citing the Second Amendment.\nStand your ground laws are sometimes referred to as "Shoot First" laws by detractors. They were part of the public discussion around the Zimmerman trial; although the legal team arguing on behalf of Zimmerman did not ask for an immunity hearing under the law, the instructions given to the jury borrowed language from the statute.\nNormally, a citizen has a duty to retreat when confronted with what they perceive to be deadly force. The stand your ground doctrine mostly removes that, meaning citizens who feel threatened are no longer required to try to quell a situation first before having the right to use deadly force in self-defense.\nGun rights groups, like the National Rifle Association, argue stand your ground laws are about protecting the right to self-defense.\nAlso testifying at the hearing was Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, a strong supporter of stand your ground laws.\nGohmert pointed out to Durbin and others in the hearing that murder rates are higher in Chicago and Washington, D.C., than they are in states that have stand-your-ground laws.\n"[The] idea of being able to stand one\'s ground without first retreating has been combined as part of the law of self-defense in at least 22 states. It might also be noted that these 22 are not necessarily states in which runaway murder rates abound," he said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nRelated content:\nThis story was originally published on Tue Oct 29, 2013 9:26 AM EDT\nPopular Discussio

However, both surveys found that support for stricter laws remains higher than it was before the Newtown shooting.\nIn a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, 48 percent of Americans said they think gun laws should be made more strict, while 16 percent said they should be made less strict and 29 percent said they preferred no change. Support for stricter gun laws in the poll is down from a high of 60 percent in a YouGov/Economist poll conducted in January, weeks after the Newtown shooting.\nSign up for membership to become a founding member and help shape HuffPost’s next chapter\nLikewise, a Gallup poll released Friday found that support for stricter gun laws has fallen from a high of 58 percent after the Newtown shooting to 49 percent now. Both the Gallup poll and the HuffPost/YouGov poll were conducted Sept. 17 and 18, after the Monday deaths of 13 people in the shooting at Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.\nAlthough support for stricter gun laws was down in both surveys from the rates seen just after the Newtown shooting, it has not fallen to levels seen before that shooting. The most recent Gallup and YouGov polls conducted before the Newtown shooting both found support for stricter gun laws below 45 percent.\nSome policies supported by advocates of stricter gun laws still receive broad support — most notably universal background checks. A HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in August found that 79 percent of Americans support universal background checks, including for gun shows and private sales. However, overall support for stricter laws has shown a marked decline over the past 25 years. Two major school shootings — Columbine and Newtown — have reversed that trend, but only temporarily.\nIn accordance with the longer-term trend against support for tightening gun laws, the post-Newtown bump in support never reached the same level that it did after Columbine.\nFollowing other mass shootings, including the recent shooting in Washington, polls have found little evidence of anything more than fleeting changes in opinion on gun laws.

Though Congress has done little to increase spending or enact laws to improve mental-health care after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shootings, dozens of states have increased or restored such funding.\nStates struggling to make ends meet during the recent recession cut more than $4 billion from their mental-health budgets from 2009 through 2012.\nNow with the one-year anniversary of the Dec. 14, 2012, Sandy Hook elementary school shootings just days away, a new report shows at least 37 states have increased spending on mental health programs.\nTexas lawmakers appear to have approved the biggest increase -- $259 million more in their newest two-year budget, the largest such increase in state history, according the National Alliance on Mental Health.\n“With few exceptions, state legislatures acknowledged the need [to] increase or maintain mental-health appropriations or enact legislation,” the group said in its 2013 State Legislation Report.\nMany of the increases are related to efforts to comply with mental-health provisions in ObamaCare that start next year. And much of the legislation enacted this year was to expand the state-federal Medicaid program under the law because it is essential in paying and providing coverage for the estimated 2.7 million uninsured Americans affected by mental illness, the report states.\nOregon, for example, increased its 2014-15 budget by roughly 22 percent to comply with the president’s signature health care law.\nThe group argues that timing also played a factor in the increases, particularly the White House’s response to the Sandy Hook shootings -- in which 20 students and six adults were fatally shot. And that the mass shooting happened right before state legislative sessions started.\nThe White House called for widespread changes including tighter school security and increased background checks on gun buyers. However, the NAMI argued the vast majority of people with mental illness is “no more violent than the general population” and called for providers of mental-health care to do a better job of complying with exist standards when reporting dangerous behavior related to gun ownership.\nThe report points out that mental-health advocates warned that the “avalanche” of state legislation could result in Americans not seeking mental-health care and that changes could threaten civil liberties.\nAmong the changes cited was the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, one of the first bills enacted in 2013 that increased the responsibilities of providers to turn over mental health records as related to gun sales. Similar SAFE acts were enacted in Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut and Tennessee.\nThe report also points out Alaska and North Carolina reduced their mental health budgets.\nThe Obama administration last month announced the final executive order of 23 that the president signed in January, while Congress has not come through in efforts to keep guns out the hands of people who are mentally ill and dangerous.\nOne change is mental health patients can now get immediate emergency room care, like somebody with a broken bone, without having to get pre-approval from their insurance company.\n"Imagine what it would mean if people felt as comfortable saying they were going for counseling as they do saying they\'re going for a flu shot or physical therapy," Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in announcing the change.\nVermont Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said before the president signed the executive orders that he didn’t know whether an assault weapons ban could pass the Senate but thought a bill to improved background checks and related ones could pass.\n"There are some who say nothing will pass,” he said. “I disagree with that. What I\'m interested in is what we can get."

Chris Christie, R-N.J., says the shooting at the Garden State Plaza mall illustrates the need for stronger mental health treatment.\nGov. Chris Christie said Tuesday that the shooting at a popular New Jersey mall, carried out by a young man who “came there to end his own life,” demonstrates the need to strengthen mental health treatment.\nThe gunman, identified by authorities as Richard Shoop, 20, fired six shots at the mall before taking his own life. Authorities found his body after 3 a.m. Tuesday at a section of the mall under construction.\nNo one else was injured — the six rounds hit an elevator, an escalator and several storefronts — but the governor stressed to reporters that the outcome could have been much worse.\nAuthorities say they found the body of the suspected gunman who fired at least six shots inside New Jersey's Garden State Mall with a modified weapon resembling an AK 47 assault rifle. No other injuries were reported. NBC's Ron Allen reports.\n“Obviously that young man came there to end his own life,” he said. “We may not be that lucky next time.”\nChristie, up for re-election Tuesday, is a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2016. He spoke after casting his ballot, and chastised the Legislature for not having strengthened mental-health protections.\n“We need to get at these root causes,” he said. “And it is not the sexiest thing in the world to talk about, to be more aggressive in the mental health area. Everybody likes to brandish guns and put them on tables and say we’re gonna ban this or ban that.”\nHe added: “What we really need to get to is, every one of these incidents involved a deeply disturbed person who was not getting treatment. We need to get to that. If we get to that, we have a better chance of preventing some of these incidents.”\nChristie said that the gunman had left a note, “and I think came there to die from all indications.” Shoop’s brother, Kevin, told reporters Tuesday that his brother didn’t mean to hurt anyone, and that the shooting was an act of “self-indulgence.”\nThe gunman was wearing all black and a helmet when he walked the mall, Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J., one of the busiest in the United States, and began firing, authorities and witnesses said. Thousands of shoppers were in the mall, just before closing time Monday night, and hundreds of shoppers were locked into stores during the chaos.\nOfficials wearing tactical gear walk outside of Garden State Plaza Mall following reports of a shooter at the Paramus, N.J., mall.\nClarice Forbes, who works at a Talbots store, told NBC New York that she spotted the gunman and that he appeared to fire a rifle into the air.\n“When we walked past our store, he looked directly in the store and strolled past. It was very, very terrifying,” she said. “There were so many thoughts going through my head. I was so scared.”\nChief Kenneth Ehrenberg of the Paramus police said that Shoop had stolen the weapon, a gun modified to look like an AK-47, from his brother. He used it to kill himself, said John Molinelli, the Bergen County prosecutor.\nMolinelli said that Shoop had a drug history, but that there was no early indication why he carried out the shooting.\nLaw enforcement officers worked into the night to search the mall and get everyone out of the stores. The mall, which has more than 200 stores and 50 restaurants, will be closed Tuesday.\nA senior law enforcement official told CNBC that the law enforcement response was “textbook,” including SWAT teams and police.

Khaled Abdullah / Reuters file\nTribesmen stand on the rubble of a building destroyed by a U.S. drone strike in the southeastern Yemeni province of Shabwa. Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, the 16-year-old son of slain U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, and six al Qaeda militants, were killed in a strike on this building on Oct. 14, 2011, tribal elders said.\nThe former top lawyer for the Pentagon said Thursday that any official involved in counterterrorism should have a “heavy heart” after reading a grandfather’s moving account of the inadvertent killing of his grandson in a U.S. drone strike.\nJeh Johnson, who served as general counsel of the Defense Department until last year, reacted strongly to a New York Times op-ed published Thursday about the slaying of 16-year-old Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, an American citizen. In the op-ed, the boy’s grandfather, Nasser al-Awlaki, described him as a “typical teenager” who watched "The Simpsons," listened to Snoop Dogg, read Harry Potter and was on his way to find his father when he was killed by a U.S. drone strike.\nSpeaking on a panel at the Aspen Security Forum, an annual gathering on national security issues, Johnson described his reaction to the piece.\n“The point I want to make is that for any responsible official of our government involved in counterterrorism, and there are number of you in this room, you read an op-ed like that and you get a pit in your stomach, and you read it with a heavy heart,” he said. “And if you don\'t, you should not be involved in these decisions."\nJeh Johnson, former general counsel for the Defense Department, is shown at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services hearing on Nov. 10, 2011.\nThe op-ed was the subject of discussion among those attending the conference, but Johnson, who oversaw legal approvals for military drone strikes at the time of the younger Al-Awlaki’s death, was the highest ranking official to speak out on the issue.\nAttorney General Eric Holder, in a letter to Congress last May, acknowledged that a drone strike had inadvertently killed the younger Awlaki – one of four Americans slain in drone attacks. The only one of the four who was specifically targeted was the boy’s father, Anwar Al-Awlaki, according to Holder’s letter.\nHolder identified the other two American victims as Samir Khan, who ran al Qaeda’s web-based propaganda magazine Inspire, and Jude Kenan Mohammed of Raleigh, N.C., who reportedly was killed in Pakistan in 2011.\nIn the op-ed, Nasser Al-Awlaki said he planned to petition a federal court to hold U.S. officials responsible for the drone strike.\n“My grandson was killed by his own government,” he wrote. “The Obama administration must answer for its actions and be hold accountable.” (The Justice Department has previously asserted that the families of victims of drone strikes don’t have standing to sue in the U.S. courts and Johnson did not address that issue in his remarks. A Justice spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. )\nRelated stories\nFBI director tells Congress agency used drones for domestic surveillance\nAnother speaker on the same panel, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero, praised ex-National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, saying that “he did this country a service” by disclosing secret NSA surveillance — including the collection of millions of Americans phone records. That has given his group and others legal standing to challenge constitutionality of those programs, he said, adding, “Guess what? … I think our country is better as a result of the revelations of Mr. Snowden.”\nThat drew a strong reaction from other panelists, including ex- Rep. Jane Harman, who formerly served as top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. She called Snowden “totally self-centered and narcissistic” and said his disclosures had done damage to national security. “It\'s not just the information about these (NSA) programs, much of which was in the public domain: It’s a whole bunch of other stuff which compromises ongoing investigations, which I think is way off.”\nMore from NBC News Investigations:\nFollow NBC News Investigations on Twitter and Facebook\nInvestigate this!\nRead and vote on readers\' story tips and suggested topics for investigation or submit your own.\nPopular Discussio

The nation\'s top military officer has laid out five options the Obama administration is considering on Syria, including "limited" strikes against the Assad regime and an all-out campaign to secure chemical weapons that includes "thousands" of U.S. forces.\nGen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, revealed the options in a letter to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich. The letter was sent as, on the other side of the Hill, the House Intelligence Committee signed off on the administration\'s call to arm the Syria opposition -- though the committee, which held that up for weeks, continued to voice reservations.\nDempsey\'s letter, released Monday, went far beyond arming the opposition in outlining potential options. He sent the letter after taking heat at last week\'s confirmation hearing from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who pressed Dempsey for his advice on Syria while suggesting the administration had not done enough -- McCain threatened to place a hold on Dempsey\'s nomination until he got answers.\nIn the letter, Dempsey gave five options on Syria beyond providing humanitarian assistance, which the U.S. already is doing.\nAt the least invasive end, he said, is the option of training, advising and assisting the rebels. The next level up would be conducting limited strikes on "high-value regime" military targets.\nThe three other options are increasingly costly and risky.\nThey include:\nA no-fly zone, which according to Dempsey could cost up to a billion dollars per month and would include shooting down regime aircraft and conducting strikes on their airfields.\nThe establishment of "buffer zones," which would be "specific geographic areas" where the opposition would safely organize and train. This would require thousands of U.S. ground forces, Dempsey said, "even if positioned outside Syria," to protect these zones.\nA campaign to secure chemical weapons. This would entail destroying portions of Syria\'s stockpile, interdicting shipments and seizing other components. At minimum, Dempsey said, this would include a no-fly zone and thousands of special operations and other forces to secure critical sites.\nDempsey stressed that these are just options that have been prepared, and that some options "may not be feasible in time or cost."\nOn another front, the House Intelligence Committee gave tentative approval toward arming the opposition.\nCommittee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Mich., said that despite "very strong concerns about the strength of the administration\'s plans in Syria and its chances for success" there was "consensus that we could move forward with what the administration\'s plans and intentions are in Syria consistent with committee reservations."\nThe Intelligence Committee had delayed the administration for weeks from fully implementing its Syria policy, including arming the rebels, Fox News has learned.\nFox also confirmed that a majority -- but not all -- of the Committee members signed off on moving forward with the plan.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, addressing the Syria crisis on Tuesday, said helping "the right set of rebels is in our nation\'s best interest."\nIt was not immediately clear how the new policy would be funded although money could be "reprogrammed" from other accounts, including possibly the defense spending bill.\nFox News\' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Islamist fighters from Somalia’s al Shabaab held out at a Nairobi shopping center after killing at least 62 people, surrounded by Kenyan forces trying to crush their group’s cross-border jihad.\nPresident Barack Obama offered U.S. support as the raid went into its fourth day, saying he believed Kenya - the scene of one of al Qaeda’s first major attacks and a neighbor of chaotic Somalia - would continue to be a regional pillar of stability.\nIt remained unclear how many fighters and hostages were still cornered in Nairobi’s Westgate shopping center on Tuesday, after a series of blasts and gunfire were followed by black smoke billowing from one part of the complex on Monday.\nHowever, the Interior Ministry said on Twitter it was “in control” of the mall and believed all hostages had been freed.\nAs long ago as 1998, al Qaeda killed more than 200 people when it bombed the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. When fighters from its Somali ideological counterpart stormed the mall last weekend, they hit a high-profile symbol of Kenya’s economic power.\nPatronized by well-to-do Kenyans and expatriates, Westgate mall epitomized the African consumer bonanza that is drawing foreign investment - from West and East - to one of the world’s fastest growing regions.\nObama, whose father was born in Kenya, said the United States stood with Kenyans against “this terrible outrage”.\n“We will provide them with whatever law enforcement support that is necessary. And we are confident that Kenya will continue to be a pillar of stability in Eastern Africa,” he said in New York.\nA Kenyan soldier holds his rifle near the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi September 23, 2013. REUTERS/Karel Prinsloo\nKenya has sent troops to Somalia as part of an African Union force trying to stabilize the country, which was long without a functioning government, and push back al Shabaab.\nIt has also suffered internal instability. President Uhuru Kenyatta, who lost a nephew in the weekend bloodbath, faces charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court for his alleged role in coordinating violence after disputed elections in 2007.\nKenyatta has dismissed a demand that he pull Kenyan forces out of Somalia, saying he would not relent in a “war on terror”.\nBritish Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he believed six Britons had died in the attack. Other known foreign victims are from China, Ghana, France, the Netherlands and Canada.\nFOREIGN FIGHTERS\nKenya believes there are also foreigners among the attackers, with military chief Julius Karangi saying they came from all over the world. “We are fighting global terrorism here,” he said, without giving their nationalities.\nWhite House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said he had no direct information that Americans had participated in the attack, but expressed U.S. worries.\n“We do monitor very carefully and have for some time been concerned about efforts by al Shabaab to recruit Americans or U.S. persons to come to Somalia,” Rhodes told reporters travelling with Obama to the United Nations in New York.\nThe siege has followed a pattern of bursts of gunfire and activity followed by long lulls. In the small hours of Tuesday, the mall was quiet after a day in which the flow of survivors escaping the complex slowed to trickle.\nArmed police patrolled but from behind the security cordon there was no sign of forces preparing to end the stalemate overnight.\nSlideshow (12 Images)\nInterior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku said the militants had set fire to mattresses in a supermarket on the mall’s lower floors and his ministry later said the blaze was under control. Two attackers were killed on Monday, taking the total of dead militants so far to three, he told a news conference.\nSpeculation rose about the identity of the attackers. Ole Lenku said they were all men but that some had dressed as women.\nDespite his assertion, one intelligence officer and two soldiers told Reuters that one of the dead militants was a white woman. This is likely to fuel speculation that she is the wanted widow of one of the suicide bombers who together killed more than 50 civilians on London’s transport system in 2005.\nCalled the “white widow” by the British press, Samantha Lewthwaite is wanted in connection with an alleged plot to attack hotels and restaurants in Kenya. Asked if the dead woman was Lewthwaite, the intelligence officer said: “We don’t know.”\nSURVIVORS’ TALES\nSurvivors’ tales of the assault by squads of attackers throwing grenades and spraying automatic fire have left little doubt the hostage-takers are willing to go on killing. Previous raids around the world, including at a desert gas plant in Algeria nine months ago, suggest they are also ready to die.\nA spokesman for al Shabaab warned they would kill hostages if Kenyan troops tried to storm their positions. “The mujahideen will kill the hostages if the enemies use force,” Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage said in an online audio statement.\nFrom Mali to Algeria, Nigeria to Kenya, violent Islamist groups - tapping into local poverty, conflict, inequality or exclusion but espousing a similar anti-Western, anti-Christian creed - are striking at state authority and international interests, both economic and political.\nJohn Campbell, a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria, said he believed insurgents such as those who rebelled in Mali last year, the Nigerian Boko Haram Islamist sect and the Nairobi mall raiders were also partly motivated by anger with what he called “pervasive malgovernance” in Africa.\n“This is undoubtedly anti-Western and anti-Christian but it also taps into a lot of deep popular anger against the political economy in which they find themselves, in which a very small group of people are basically raking off the wealth,” he said.

Members of the president\'s party in Tunisia will quit the coalition government, the state-run news agency TAP reported Sunday.\nThe move threatens to worsen a political crisis, set off after an opposition leader was assassinated there last week.\nThe Congress for the Republic Party, which counts Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki among its ranks, has three ministers and two secretaries of state in the government, TAP reported.\nThe five officials will "continue to shoulder their responsibilities within their respective departments to avoid any administrative vacuum," TAP said, citing Chokri Yacoub, a party leader.\nThe news comes one day after Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali said he would step down if a caretaker government he is forming fails to win approval from Tunisia\'s National Constituent Assembly.\nIn response to the shooting death of Chokri Belaid, Jebali sacked his government and said he would appoint a new one to serve until the next election.\nHowever, a top official of Jebali\'s own Ennahda party labeled Jebali\'s moves "non-binding," raising questions about his leadership.\nBelaid, a prominent secular politician who decried violence, was shot dead as he left his home Wednesday morning for work. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Belaid\'s widow and others blamed the climate fostered by Jebali\'s Ennahda party.\nJebali denied that Ennahda had anything do with Belaid\'s killing and said he hoped to get approval for his new government from his party and others.\n"The government, I feel, is backed by a lot of people, mainly among ordinary people. I hope that political parties will translate the view of our people," Jebali said Friday.\nAs he spoke, thousands of Tunisians demonstrated in the streets of the capital in outrage over the assassination, calling on Jebali to resign.\nThe killing of Belaid was the country\'s first high-profile political assassination since Tunisia\'s "Jasmine Revolution" that toppled President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali two years ago and spawned the Arab Spring.

TACOMA, Washington (Reuters) - A U.S. Army sergeant who killed 16 Afghan civilians in cold blood last year pleaded guilty on Wednesday to premeditated murder and other charges under a deal with military prosecutors to avoid the death penalty.\nStaff Sergeant Robert Bales, a decorated veteran of four combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, admitted to roaming off his Army post in the Afghan province of Kandahar last March to gun down and set fire to unarmed villagers, mostly women and children, in attacks on their family compounds.\n“As far as why, I’ve asked that question a million times since then,” Bales said, in a calm, steady voice, when asked by the judge for an explanation. “There is not a good reason in this world for why I did the horrible things that I did.”\nThe slayings marked the worst case of civilian slaughter blamed on a rogue U.S. soldier since the Vietnam War and further strained U.S.-Afghan relations after more than a decade of conflict in that country.\nBales, 39, now faces a maximum punishment of life in prison without the possibility of parole. A military jury will decide his sentence after further proceedings set to begin August 19.\nProsecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty in return for Bales’ guilty plea to the murder charges he faced.\nThe presiding judge, Army Colonel Jeffery Nance, accepted the agreement at the end of a lengthy hearing during which Bales was required to recount the events in question and to convince the judge he understood his plea and the consequences of his acts.\nWearing a military dress uniform, Bales stood beside his lawyer, Emma Scanlan, as she entered guilty pleas on his behalf to 16 counts of premeditated murder, six counts of attempted murder and seven counts of assault, as well as to alcohol and drug charges.\nReading through the list of charges himself, one at a time, later in the hearing, Bales acknowledged that he committed 10 of the slayings by shooting and burning his victims and that he killed six others by gunshot only.\n“I then did kill her by shooting her with a firearm and burning her. This act was without legal justification,” he said during a matter-of-fact recitation of his crimes, delivered with no visible sign of emotion.\nINTENT TO KILL\nAsked by Nance if he had acted out of self-defense, or under orders, or whether he had any other legal justification to kill the 16 villagers, Bales replied, “No, sir.”\n“Could you have avoided killing them if you wanted to?” the judge asked.\n“Yes, sir,” he answered, adding that he “formed the intent (to kill) as I raised my weapon.” Bales said that setting fire to his victims was also done with the intent to kill, and that he was aware it was “against their cultural norms.”\nBales has claimed his memories of the killings are spotty, but he acknowledged seeing a lantern at one point during the rampage and that matches were later found in his possession. He said he learned from previous testimony that kerosene was used in the burnings.\nArmy prosecutors have said Bales acted alone and with chilling premeditation when, armed with a pistol, a rifle and a grenade launcher, he left his post twice during the night to attack civilians. He is alleged to have returned to base in the middle of the rampage to tell a fellow soldier: “I just shot up some people.”\nDefense attorneys have argued that Bales, the father of two from Lake Tapps, Washington, was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his deployment to Afghanistan.\nDuring a nine-day pre-trial hearing in November, witnesses testified that Bales had been angered by a bomb blast near his outpost that severed a fellow soldier’s leg days before the shootings.\nUnder questioning from Nance, Bales said that his use of illegal steroids, which he admitted taking to improve muscle tone and recovery time from missions, also “increased my irritability and anger.”\nBales’ wife was seated behind him in the courtroom benches at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Washington.\nDuring the hearing, Bales requested that one third of the jury panel for the sentencing phase of the proceedings consist of enlisted military personnel, as opposed to officers.\nThe plea deal entered on Wednesday was similar to an agreement struck at Lewis-McChord in April, when Army Sergeant John Russell pleaded guilty to killing two fellow U.S. servicemen at a military counseling center in Iraq, near Baghdad’s airport, in a 2009 shooting spree.\nRussell was sentenced to life in prison without parole following an abbreviated court-martial stemming from one of the worst cases of violence by an American soldier against other U.S. troops.

Two U.S. embassy officials were wounded Tuesday in a shooting, apparently at a strip club, in Caracas, Venezuela.\nThe U.S. State Department said two members of the embassy suffered non-life-threatening injuries but did not provide details.\nPolice and investigators combed the club, in the basement of a mall, but did not speak to reporters outside on Tuesday.\nSigns posted outside the door of the club described it as a "weapon-free zone" and said the entrance of couples, unaccompanied women or anyone under 30 is forbidden.\nImages of scantily clad women dancing around poles were plastered on a wall just inside the club\'s entrance.\nThe club\'s manager said on Tuesday night that the shooting had occurred inside the establishment.\nThe injured U.S. officials worked with the embassy\'s defense liaison office, according to two U.S. officials who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.\nThe two injured embassy officials were shot at a club in northeast Caracas, said an attending physician at a hospital in the Venezuelan capital. One was shot in the abdomen and the leg, and the other in the abdomen, Dr. Carlos Pacheco said.\nState Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell would not elaborate on what kind of establishment the officials were at, except to say it was "some sort of social spot."\nAsked Tuesday afternoon whether the shooting had occurred at a strip club, Ventrell told reporters, "I have no information on the site whatsoever."\nThe department was not aware of any arrests, Ventrell said, but it is in contact with local authorities.\nEmbassy security and health unit personnel were at the hospital and have reached out to the officials\' families, Ventrell said.

A controversial republican parade in Castlederg, County Tyrone has passed off without major incident.\nThe Tyrone Volunteers Day Parade commemorated republicans who died during the Troubles, including two IRA men killed by their own bomb.\nSeveral hundred bandsmen and republican supporters took part in the march.\nHundreds of protesters, including some family members of IRA murder victims, staged a counter-demonstration against the parade.\nEarlier, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers had urged organisers to call off the march, saying it was "causing great hurt" to victims of terrorism.\nThe commemoration angered many unionists and several leading politicians had called on Ms Villiers to ban the parade.\n\'Glorify terrorism\'\nA heavy police presence was in place in the town ahead of both the parade and the protest, after 56 officers were injured during a loyalist demonstration against a republican parade in Belfast on Friday evening.\nThe Castlederg parade, which was supported by Sinn Féin, began after 15:00 BST on Sunday and supporters clapped as it moved off.\nThe counter-demonstration was staged by the Derg Valley Victims Voice, who said the march would glorify terrorism and traumatise families affected by IRA violence.\nThe protesters held banners opposing the commemoration and some of them shouted \'disgrace\' as the march began.\nAt one stage, a man whose relative had been killed by the IRA managed to break through the line to vent his anger, but was stopped by stewards.\nThe Parades Commission had placed restrictions on the march, which the parade organisers had already re-routed away from the town\'s war memorial.\nAt a newly built republican memorial in Castlederg, the names of dead republicans were read out to the marchers.\nThey included the names of the two IRA men, who died when the bomb they were transporting exploded prematurely in 1973.\n\'Hierarchy of victims\'\nSinn Féin North Belfast MLA, Gerry Kelly, addressed the marchers, criticising what he called the "media maelstrom of attacks" ahead of the event.\nMr Kelly said: "No unionist MLA, councillor, MP or minister, no loyalist paramilitary or loyal order spokesperson - no matter how loud they shout, will prevent me or any other republican honouring our comrades who gave their lives in the struggle for Irish freedom and equality."\nHe added that the centre of Castlederg was supposed to be a "shared space" and almost 20 unionist marches had taken place in the town so far this year.\n"Yet when a single republican commemoration parade is organised we are confronted with a deluge of orchestrated complaints.\n"In effect we are being told that it is right for unionism to remember their British dead without interference but how dare republicans remember their Irish dead in the same way."\nMr Kelly said there must not be "a hierarchy of victims which would discriminate against republicans and nationalists not just in life, but in death also".\n\'Intense provocation\'\nThe Ulster Unionist representatives for the area, Ross and Derek Hussey, were among those attending the counter-demonstration.\nRoss Hussey said: "In the face of intense provocation from apologists for murder, the families maintained their dignity and ensured that the memories of their loved ones will always rise above that of the bombers and those that celebrate murderers."\nHe added: "Despite Sinn Féin dancing on the graves of IRA victims, the people of Castlederg sent out a strong message today that they will not be faced down by Sinn Féin.\n"As for Sinn Fein themselves, I don`t think they have any shame - celebrating Irish republican bombers on the same day as families gather in Omagh to remember their loved ones, murdered by Irish republican bombers in that town 15 years ago"

A senior rebel commander with the Free Syrian Army has been shot and killed by jihadis. As Paul Wood reports, the killing is part of an escalating struggle within the armed uprising between moderates and Islamists linked to al-Qaeda.\nThe Free Syrian Army commander, stocky, bearded, dressed in camouflage, oozed menace and seethed with righteous anger.\nWe were speaking about the biggest jihadi group in Syria, the Nusra Front, who had kidnapped his brother.\n"I know the names of all their emirs [leaders]. They will have nowhere to hide. This will be all-out war," he said.\nHe explained that he was now free to take his revenge because he had just paid $50,000 (£33,000) to get his brother out.\nHe had hated to do this because Nusra would just spend the money on weapons to use against the FSA.\nHe told me they had sent a suicide bomber to infiltrate his command post, killing 12 of his men.\nThey were able to do that, he complained bitterly, only because he had sent most of his troops to fight in Qusayr, which later fell to the regime.\n\'Powerful players\'\nI met that particular commander in Turkey, not far from the border with Syria, 10 days ago.\nHe was describing a long-standing and often bloody enmity among those fighting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad - "secular" against jihadi, "moderate" versus "extremist".\nThat struggle has now resulted in the loss of one of the FSA\'s most senior figures, Kamal Hamami, who commanded an important brigade in his native north-western province of Latakia.\nOne word about this on Facebook can earn you a bulletActivist who spoke out about FSA looting\nEven as the Syrian regime pushes back the rebels on several fronts, a civil war within the civil war is building on the opposition side.\nA spokesman for the FSA\'s Supreme Military Council said Mr Hamami had been driving through Latakia when they ran into a checkpoint run by the main group linked to al-Qaeda in Syria, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\nThe fighters at the checkpoint refused to let him pass, saying he would need to get permission from their emir. He told them they had to take their checkpoint down.\nAs the argument raged, one of the fighters - a foreign jihadi from Iraq, it is said - raised his weapon and shot Mr Hamami. The FSA men retreated with their mortally wounded commander.\nAccording to the FSA, the emir gave a long list of reasons for the killing, one of which included the fact he was a member of the FSA\'s Supreme Military Council.\nThe FSA said the Islamic State had threatened to kill all of the other members of the Supreme Military Council - another sign of the escalating struggle within the armed uprising.\nThis is partly a battle over spoils, partly ideological.\nIn truth, almost all of those fighting the regime are to some degree religious, including those FSA brigades commonly labelled "secular".\nThe crucial difference, though, is that the "secular" FSA will accept a civil state while the jihadis are fighting to establish an Islamic theocracy.\nA year ago, the jihadis were still operating almost underground in Syria. Now they are powerful and important players, in some places running whole towns, where they impose Sharia law.\n"This is a disaster for us, a disaster for the revolution," a female opposition activist told me.\nShe was complaining about Islamist gunmen telling her not to smoke, to cover her head, and to leave meetings where she was the only woman.\n"We do not want these people," she went on, referring to the foreign fighters who have joined jihadi brigades. "This is not Syria."\nShe admitted that the jihadis had grown in popularity because of corruption and infighting among the FSA. Many rebel groups were preying on the people they are supposed to be fighting for, she conceded.\nI spoke to another activist who had spent two years on the run from the regime, only to finally flee Syria because he spoke out against looting by the FSA. "One word about this on Facebook can earn you a bullet," he told me.\nThe moral clarity of the early days of the uprising has been lost.\nThen, people wanted to defend themselves against overwhelming and brutal force - and ultimately to replace a corrupt, one-party dictatorship.\nNow many people tell me the revolution itself has become corrupt and, in rebel-held areas, they fear a different kind of tyranny: crime, kidnapping, gangsterism.\n\'Starved of weapons\'\nBy the laws of sheer demographics in Syria, President Assad should have been finished long ago. Three quarters of the country is Sunni and this is a predominantly Sunni uprising.\nBut now some who supported the revolution are even switching, however reluctantly, to the regime, as the lesser of two evils. The result is that the government is looking stronger than ever.\nThe town of Qusayr fell to a government offensive six weeks ago.\nIt looks very much like the last rebel pockets in the much bigger city of Homs will be next.\nOne of those pockets is Khaldiya. For two years the rebels held out here, but now government tanks are closing in.\nAn activist reached by Skype told us that most people have fled Khaldiya, just fighters and their families remaining, living in medieval conditions without power and running water.\nIn a video uploaded to YouTube, three FSA fighters stand looking at the camera and declare they will defend Khaldiya to their last breath.\n"This is the only weapon we have left," says one, pointing to a suicide belt he is wearing. "By God\'s will, we can hold this place."\nThe suicide belt is a sign of how Islamist ideology has spread even through the FSA, as well as of how desperate the battle against the regime has become.\nThe rebels in the Khaldiya suicide belt video are clear where the blame lies for what - despite their declaration - seems like an imminent defeat.\nThey have been abandoned by the outside world, they say, and even by their own leadership in the FSA. They say that, starved of weapons, they had little against a Syrian regime armed with tanks, artillery, jets and Scuds.\nToo late?\nFor Western governments thinking about arming the rebels, there are many worrying questions: What if the weapons are used in a sectarian massacre of Shias and Alawites? What if the jihadis get hold of anti-aircraft missiles and use them in Europe or the US?\nAgainst that, there is the risk that staying out will allow the Syrian inferno to light fires beyond Syria\'s borders.\nOne in four Syrians have fled their homes, many into neighbouring countries. There is a risk of destabilising the whole region.\nSectarian violence has already spread to Lebanon. A car bomb in Shia, Hezbollah-controlled southern Beirut, this week was payback for Hezbollah\'s involvement in the battle for Qusayr, it is said.\nJordan, straining with more than half a million refugees, is also said to be at risk.\nTo stop the killing, outside powers are trying to force both sides to the negotiating table.\nPresident Assad will not go, presumably, unless he feels seriously in peril - that is one reason, it is argued, to arm the rebels.\nBut if the balance tips too far the other way, the rebels would not want to talk if they felt they were winning on the battlefield.\nIf Western governments do decide to step in, there are some rebels they might feel they could do business with, represented by the FSA\'s Supreme Military Council, the body on which the murdered commander, Kamal Hamami sat.\nAt the top of the Supreme Military Council sits General Salim Idris, the FSA\'s chief of staff. He talks, reassuringly for Western governments, not of revenge or of Sharia law, but of human rights and democracy.\nThe relatively secular rebel groups are in the minority. On many frontlines, they are not militarily as significant as other groups that Western governments would find problematic.\nThe hope in London, Paris and Washington, is that the "moderate" FSA will grow in power and influence with Western support.\nThe question is, as the regime\'s offensive continues, is it too late?

PRETORIA (Reuters) - A judge is likely to decide on Friday whether to grant bail to Oscar Pistorius, with prosecutors arguing he is a cold-blooded killer and his own lawyers that he is far too famous to have any chance of fleeing prosecution.\nThe bail hearing, which began last Friday, was set to resume at 0800 GMT.\nDefense lawyers for Pistorius say the athlete shot dead his girlfriend only by terrible mistake, and deserves bail to prepare for a case that has garnered global attention and has been marred by a bungled police investigation.\nThe star “blade runner”, whose lower legs were amputated in infancy, has become an even more globally recognized figure since he killed model Reeva Steenkamp, 29, in the pre-dawn hours of Valentine’s Day at his home.\nProsecutors have told the court it was a premeditated murder, with Pistorius firing four shots through a locked toilet door at a cowering Steenkamp on the other side. She was hit in the head, arm and hip.\nWitnesses said they heard a gunshots and screams from the home in a gated community surrounded by 3-metre- (yard-) high stone walls and topped with an electric fence.\nPistorius contends he was acting in self-defense, mistaking Steenkamp for an intruder and feeling vulnerable because he was unable to attach his prosthetic limbs in time to confront the threat, he said in an affidavit read in court.\nThe 26-year-old said he grabbed a 9-mm pistol from under his bed and went into the bathroom.\nPistorius described how he fired into the locked toilet door in a blind panic in the mistaken belief that the intruder was lurking inside.\nBail hearings in South Africa allow for prosecutors and defense lawyers to lay out their basic arguments, based on preliminary evidence.\nSlideshow (7 Images)\nThe arrest of Pistorius stunned millions who watched in awe last year as the Olympic and Paralympic sprinter reached the semi-final of the 400 m in the London Olympics.\nThe impact has been greatest in sports-mad South Africa, where Pistorius was seen as a rare hero who commanded respect from both blacks and whites, transcending the racial divides that persist 19 years after the end of apartheid.\nPolice investigating Pistorius pulled their lead detective off the athlete’s case on Thursday after it emerged he himself faces attempted murder charges for shooting at a minibus.

A Republican lawmaker on Wednesday appeared to suggest that President Barack Obama is “getting perilously close” to meeting the criteria for impeachment.\n“I think those are serious things, but we’re in serious times,” said Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn during a town hall in his home state.\n“And I don’t have the legal background to know if that rises to ‘high crimes and misdemeanors,’ but I think you’re getting perilously close.”\nThe remark came after an attendee called the Obama administration "lawless" and asked, "who is responsible for enforcing [Obama’s] constitutional responsibilities?"\n“What you have to do is you have to establish the criteria that would qualify for proceedings against the president. And that’s called impeachment,” he said as some in the audience applauded.\nHe added that the House of Representatives is responsible for bringing charges against the president.\n“I think there’s some intended violation of the law in this administration but I also think there’s a ton of incompetence,” he added.\nCoburn said that he does not know if the constitutional standard for impeachment has been met, and he said that that such proceedings should not be “something you take lightly.”\n“I’m documenting all this stuff as it goes along, but I don’t know where that level is,” he added.\nIt was unclear what specific instance Coburn was referencing as possible grounds for impeachment, although he mentioned that he believes Department of Homeland Security officials have told career USCIS employees to “ignore” background checks for immigrants. The questioner also mentioned the Internal Revenue Service at one point.\nA Coburn spokesman was not immediately available for comment.\nCoburn, who described himself as a “personal friend” of Obama’s, said he was “fed up” and “frustrated” with the status quo.\n“He became my friend in the Senate but that does not mean I agree in any way with what he’s doing or how he’s doing it,” he said. “And I quite frankly think he’s in a difficult position he’s put himself in, and if it continues, I think we’re going to have another constitutional crisis in our country in terms of the presidency.”\nThis story was originally published on Thu Aug 22, 2013 6:48 PM EDT\nPopular Discussio

On Monday, while the death toll mounted at the Navy Yard, President Barack Obama delivered a strident partisan tirade against Republicans, using the fifth anniversary of the Lehman Brothers collapse to score political points ahead of the debt ceiling debate. It was an appalling act of division and insensitivity, and unlike George W. Bush’s on 9/11, it was a calculated abdication of leadership.

Local law enforcement agencies across the country are facing an ammo shortage, as gun owners concerned about new laws at the federal and state level stock up on firearms and bullets.\nAt the same time, the Department of Homeland Security has said it wants to buy more than 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition in the next four or five years -- which could put further strain on the supply.\nThe shortage, coupled with an increase in prices, comes as many gun owners head to the stores in anticipation of new gun control laws. States like Colorado and New York have already approved such legislation, while Democrats move toward bringing a bill to the Senate floor. At the moment, the congressional bill does not include an assault-weapons ban, but a ban is expected to be floated as an amendment.\nStill, what one official described as "panic-buying" set in, as lawmakers rallied to draft new legislation in the wake of a series of tragic mass shootings last year, from Aurora, Colo., to Oak Creek, Wis., to Newtown, Conn.\nIn Tennessee\'s Hamilton County, the sheriff\'s department says its officers will be given fewer bullets when they train at the range.\n"The concern over firearms availability and ammunition availability and potentials of gun control certainly has impacted the availability of ammunition purchased locally," training coordinator Jody Mays said, according to WDEF.\nEarlier this year, Rollingwood Police Chief Dayne Pryor told MyFoxAustin.com that "panic-buying" is contributing to a situation where officers trying to order new firearms are being forced to wait. He said the city, which is outside Austin, has been told to expect wait times to purchase AR-15s and ammunition.\n"We have adequate supplies right now, but we\'re limited to how often we can go to the firing range to train because we want to be conservative right now," he said.\nSimilarly, the Jenks Police Department in Oklahoma has faced rising ammo and assault weapons costs.\nPolice Chief Cameron Arthur said the department is still waiting on an order from October, according to KJRH.\nMeanwhile, according to CNSNews.com, Rep. Timothy Huelskamp, R-Kan., said he still hasn\'t heard back from the Department of Homeland Security on why it\'s buying 1.6 billion rounds.\nThe Homeland Security Department, though, has said it needs the bullets for law enforcement agents in training and on duty.\nPublished federal notices about the ammo buy have agitated conspiracy theorists since the fall. The government\'s explanation is much less sinister.\nThe Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Ga., and others like it run by DHS use up to 15 million rounds a year, mostly on shooting ranges and in training exercises.\nMore than 90 federal agencies and 70,000 agents and officers used the department\'s training center last year.\nThe rest of the 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition would be purchased by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal government\'s second largest criminal investigative agency.\nThe Homeland Security ammo buy is not the first time the government\'s bullets purchases have sparked concerns on the Internet. The same thing happened last year when the Social Security Administration posted a notice that it was buying 174,000 hollow point bullets.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

People who fire guns at drones are endangering the public and property and could be prosecuted or fined, the Federal Aviation Administration warned Friday.\nThe FAA released a statement in response to questions about an ordinance under consideration in the tiny farming community of Deer Trail, Colo., that would encourage hunters to shoot down drowns. The administration reminded the public that it regulates the nation\'s airspace, including the airspace over cities and towns.\n"I want to take a stand against the coming surveillance society that seems to be rushing in on us," Phillip Steel, a resident in town who drafted the ordinance and submitted it for approval by the town board, told "Fox and Friends."\nOfficials in the town admit they have never seen a drone plane on the Eastern Plains, but they want to make a statement that they think using unmanned surveillance planes to spy on people in the United States is wrong. They say the ordinance is mostly symbolic. They also recognize it\'s against federal law to destroy federal property.\nThe FAA for its part said a drone "hit by gunfire could crash, causing damage to persons or property on the ground, or it could collide with other objects in the air. Shooting at an unmanned aircraft could result in criminal or civil liability, just as would firing at a manned airplane."\nUnder the proposed ordinance, Deer Trail would grant hunting permits to shoot drones. The permits would cost $25 each. The town would also encourage drone hunting by awarding $100 to anyone who presents a valid hunting license and identifiable pieces of a drone that has been shot down.\nSteel, 48, said in an interview that he has 28 signatures on a petition — roughly 10 percent of the town\'s registered voters. Under Colorado law, that requires local officials to formally consider the proposal at a meeting next month. Town officials would then have the option of adopting the ordinance or putting it on the ballot in an election this fall, he said.\nThe proposed ordinance is mostly a symbolic protest against small, civilian drones that are coming into use in the United States, Steel said. He acknowledged that it\'s unlikely there are any drones in use near Deer Trail.\nThe head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation acknowledged in June that his agency uses drones to conduct surveillance in the United States, but said they do so rarely, The Wall Street Journal reported . FBI director Robert Mueller said the agency uses them "in a very, very minimal way, very seldom."\nFederal agencies have been using drones for years to monitor the northern and southern borders of the U.S., and those drones have occasionally been deployed to help domestic law-enforcement agencies like the FBI.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama on Saturday praised the nation\'s police officers for everyday acts of courage, saying they often rush into danger to do "some really tough stuff."\nIn a White House ceremony honoring some of the bravest, he said America need look no further than the Boston Marathon bombings to know what police are made of: "Police officers ... running towards explosions not knowing if there was something more on the way. Law enforcement from different agencies in different parts of the country working together as one united team to identify suspects and bring them to justice."\nHe said few will ever forget the end of the marathon manhunt in Watertown, Mass. Suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a gunbattle with police, and residents cheered and gave police high fives after his brother Dzhokhar was apprehended.\n"We don\'t always get that opportunity to stand and applaud the men and women who keep us safe," Obama said. "But they\'re out there — hundreds of thousands of you patrolling our streets every single day. And we know that when we need you most, you\'ll be ready to dash into danger, to protect our lives, even if it means putting your lives on the line."\nObama was flanked by award recipients, many in uniform, with families, friends and other officers looking on from the audience in the East Room.\nThe annual ceremony honored 43 law enforcement officers who are recipients of the National Association of Police Organizations TOP COPS award.\nThe group included eight officers from the Oak Creek, Wis., police force who battled a gunman at a Sikh temple last Aug. 5. The gunman killed six people before turning his weapon on himself. Obama singled out Brian Murphy, the first to arrive, who, he said, suffered 12 bullet wounds.\nHe also singled out New York police Detective Ivan Marcano, who was off duty in the Bronx with his girlfriend when he saw muggers attack a cab driver. Obama recounted Marcano being shot inches from his heart yet still giving chase to the suspects — holding his wound with one hand and his weapon with the other. Obama had Marcano\'s girlfriend stand, saying, "This was his date night! It\'s unbelievable."

FOUNTAIN HILLS, Arizona (Reuters) - Action film star Steven Seagal, who racks up big body counts in his on-screen battles with bad guys, took on a new role on Saturday, training posse volunteers for controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio in how to use guns to protect schools in shooting incidents.\nMaricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio (L) watches as actor and Maricopa County posse member Steven Seagal addresses the media about a simulated school shooting in Fountain Hills, Arizona, February 9, 2013. Controversial Arizona lawman Joe Arpaio, who styles himself as "America\'s Toughest Sheriff," has enlisted action film star Steven Seagal to lead a training exercise for members of his armed volunteer posse on how to respond to a school shooting. REUTERS/Darryl Webb\nArpaio, who styles himself as “America’s Toughest Sheriff,” enlisted Seagal to train his Maricopa County posse members at a school in Fountain Hills, a suburb northeast of Phoenix, with children used as stand-ins for scared students.\nSeagal, a burly martial arts expert turned actor, guided 48 volunteers through various aspects of responding to a shooting, including room-to-room searches, and critiqued their work.\n“I am here to try to teach the posse firearms and martial arts to try to help them learn how to respond quicker and help protect our children,” Seagal said.\nArpaio, whose tough stances on crime and illegal immigration have made him a national figure, has dispatched the volunteer posse to patrol schools in response to the shooting rampage that killed 20 children and six adults at a Connecticut school in December.\nThose killings touched off a renewed debate over gun violence in the United States. President Barack Obama proposed a sweeping package of gun-control measures, including a ban on assault weapons.\nThe National Rifle Association, which opposes the gun-control proposal, has advocated placing armed security guards in schools.\nArpaio’s volunteers, some trained and qualified to carry the same guns as deputies, can intervene if there is an imminent threat to life. To add realism to the training event, guns firing non-lethal rounds that leave a color mark were used.\n“It’s important to help protect our children and our schools and we need to do that with whatever means we have,” said Rick Velotta, a posse member and retired General Electric manager who attended the training.\nAbout a dozen people protested the event.\n“No gun should ever be in a school,” said protester Cynthia Wharton, a Fountain Hills resident.\nArpaio’s 3,450-strong posse of unpaid men and women has for years helped the sheriff target drunken drivers and illegal immigrants, and chase down fathers who are behind on child support.\nLast year, Arpaio sent posse members to Hawaii to investigate the authenticity of Obama’s birth certificate at the request of local Tea Party activists, a key Arpaio constituency.\nA sometime resident of the Phoenix Valley and member of Arpaio’s posse, Seagal, 60, starred in big-budget films in the 1980s and early 1990s, earning a reputation as an action star in movies like “Above the Law” and “Under Siege.”\nHe more recently played a corrupt Mexican drug lord in the 2010 film “Machete.”\nSeagal also has been sworn in as a sheriff’s deputy in a Texas county along the border with Mexico and appeared in a reality TV show detailing his work as a reserve deputy in New Orleans.

%22He was completely normal%22\nStudents in Tsarnaev%27s dorm say the alleged bomber did not appear radical\nBomb suspect described as likeable%2C friendly%2C often high on pot\nDARTMOUTH, Mass. -- Friends and classmates of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev can\'t grasp how the pot-smoking, party boy they knew is the same young man now accused of carrying out a terrorist attack.\nTsarnaev was funny, sarcastic, liked to party and frequently reeked of marijuana, said students in a sophomore residence at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth where the alleged bomber lived.\nSeveral students on Tuesday described a shared shock and disbelief as classmates discovered that Tsarnaev faces federal charges of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction.\n"It\'s like finding out your best friend is a serial killer," said Jennifer Mendez, who met Tsarnaev last year in their freshmen dorm. "He was really social and hilarious. He was one of those people who would crack one joke and make your night."\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, and his brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, carried out two explosions that rocked the Boston Marathon on April 15, federal officials say. The bombs left three people dead and more than 260 others injured.\nLast Thursday, the two allegedly gunned down Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier as they were being sought by authorities. The older brother was killed in a confrontation with police early Friday morning. The younger Tsarnaev brother now faces criminal charges that carry a possible death sentence.\nMendez, 20, grew close with Dzhokar Tsarnaev. Both moved into Pine Dale Hall to start their sophomore year.\nOn Sunday, the FBI searched Tsarnaev\'s dorm room in that building and seized BBs, a large pyrotechnic, and "a black jacket and a white hat of the same general appearance as those worn by Bomber Two at the Boston marathon on April 15," according to the criminal complaint filed against Tsarnaev.\nMendez can\'t imagine the motives behind Tsarnaev\'s alleged actions. Like many in Pine Dale Hall, she didn\'t connect the blurry picture of Suspect Two to their classmate.\nIn the years she knew him, Mendez said Tsarnaev just enjoyed playing soccer, talked about his years wrestling and mulled over the demands of college life: professors, classes, and homework. Partying and drinking filled their days, she said, and Tsarnaev did not show signs he was becoming radical or changing in any way.\nHer best memories are of the two sitting outside Maple Ridge Hall, the freshman dorm they shared, talking about school and the excitement of being in college.\nMendez, a biology and chemistry double major, last partied with Tsarnaev last semester. The demands of her studies slowed her partying down this semester, but Tsarnaev seemed normal when she sat in politics class with him or when she passed him on the way to his third-floor dorm.\nTsarnaev shared that third-floor dorm room with another student, said Patrick Yaghoobian, 20, who lived next -door to the pair all school year.\n"He smoked a lot of pot," he said of Tsarnaev on Tuesday afternoon. "He smelled like it every day."\nA strong smell of marijuana emanated from the room throughout the school year while Tsarnaev, himself, reeked of the drug, Yaghoobian said. The smell was absent last Monday when the bombing took place.\nHe said Tsarnaev was a quiet kid who walked around with the same blank, emotionless expression seen in many of the photos released by the FBI.\nThe Millbury, Mass., native added that there were no signs of radicalism: "I\'ve looked into his room a few times, and there was nothing religious or nothing that screamed out he was Muslim."

(REUTERS)\nThe worldwide terror threat is growing and changing, making Americans less safe than they were in years past, the leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees said Sunday.\n“Terror is up worldwide,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. “The statistics indicate that. The fatalities are way up.”\nFeinstein made her comments on CNN’s “State of the Union” during a joint interview with Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, who argued the terror group Al Qaeda continues to grow and consolidate.\n“What\'s happening in places like Syria [is] that you have a pooling of Al Qaeda and affiliates. … Groups have changed the way they communicate, which means it\'s less likely that we\'re going to be able to detect something prior to an event.”\nRogers also suggested that public scrutiny over U.S. intelligence work, brought on by recent disclosures about the efforts of the National Security Agency and others, has hurt anti-terror efforts.\n“We’re fighting amongst ourselves here in this country about the role of our intelligence community,” he said. “That is having an impact on our ability to stop what is a growing number of threats. Our intelligence community isn’t the bad guys.”\nRogers also said terrorists are adopting the idea that "maybe smaller events are OK" and still might achieve their goals.\n"That makes it exponentially harder for our intelligence services to stop an event like that from happening," he said.\nFeinstein attributed the growing threat in part to improved weaponry.\n"There are new bombs, very big bombs, trucks being reinforced for those bombs," she said.\nThough neither lawmaker offered specifics about what led them to their conclusions, Feinstein spoke generally of "a real displaced aggression in this very fundamentalist jihadist Islamic community, and that is that the West is responsible for everything that goes wrong and that the only thing that\'s going to solve this is Islamic Shariah law and the concept of the caliphate."\nThe caliphate is an Islamic state led by a religious and political leader, or caliph, considered a successor of the Prophet Muhammad and who governs by Shariah law.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

The picture emerging of the dead gunman in Monday\'s rampage at the Washington Navy Yard is a study in contrasts, one of a man who practiced languages and meditated, and another of a cold-blooded killer.\nThe gunman was identified as 34-year-old Aaron Alexis, a former Navy reservist and a current military contractor, the Washington FBI Field Office told CNN. His identity was confirmed by fingerprints and a picture ID card, the FBI said.\nAuthorities have not released a possible motive in the morning shooting at the headquarters for Naval Sea Systems Command that left 12 people -- and the gunman -- dead. But a friend said Alexis was locked in a dispute over money with the company that contracted him to work for the Navy.\nInvestigators also learned that Alexis had recently made contact with two Veterans Administration hospitals for apparent psychological issues, law enforcement sources told CNN on Tuesday.\nAuthorities said earlier that they are confident that Alexis was the lone gunman, bringing to an end a daylong police search for a possible second suspect.\nAlexis was carrying a military-contractor ID that matched his appearance, a D.C. Metropolitan Police official told CNN on condition of anonymity.\nAlexis used that ID to gain access to the Navy Yard, according to a U.S. law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation.\nHe drove onto the installation and parked before walking a short distance to Building 197. Once inside, according to the official, Alexis made his way to an overlook above the atrium and opened fire into the cafeteria.\nInitial reports said Alexis used an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle during the attack, but by Tuesday, law enforcement sources with knowledge of the investigation said that was not the case.\nIt is believed that Alexis had rented an AR-15, but returned it before Monday\'s shooting, the officials said. Investigators have recovered three weapons from the scene, including a shotgun that Alexis is believed to have brought into the compound. The other two weapons -- handguns -- the sources say, may have been taken from guards.\nWhile the FBI was urging anyone with information about Alexis to come forward, investigators were focusing on reported incidents, including police run-ins, that portray a man with increasingly violent tendencies.\nAlexis was believed to have arrived in the Washington area last week, when he reportedly checked into a hotel, according to someone who met him at the hotel. The person, who declined to be identified, said Alexis indicated that he planned to be in the area for several weeks.\nAt the time of the shooting, Alexis was working for The Experts, a subcontractor of HP Enterprise Services that was contracted to "refresh equipment used on the Navy Marine Corps Intranet network," according to a statement released by the company.\nAlexis, who had Department of Defense security clearance, worked from September 2012 through January refreshing computer systems in Japan, said Thomas E. Hoshko, the CEO of The Experts.\nAlexis began working at the Navy Yard last week, though it was unclear whether he had actually begun working or was still securing his base clearance, Hoshko said.\nThere were no indications that Alexis had any ideological differences with the Navy or any disagreements with anyone at the Navy Yard, the U.S. law enforcement official said.\n"What I do know is he wasn\'t that type of person," Anthony Little, who identified himself as Alexis\' brother-in-law, told reporters outside his Brooklyn, New York, home. "I didn\'t really hear anything that would make me feel, as a newcomer to the family, that somebody should be watching him."\n"You know, they didn\'t see it coming," said Little, who is married to Alexis\' sister Naomi. "Their hearts are going out more to the victims and the people that got hurt because, you know, there\'s more lives lost and we don\'t need that right now. We really don\'t."\nIn the Navy, he achieved the rank of aviation electrician\'s mate 3rd class, working on aircraft electrical systems, the records show.\nAlexis was honorably discharged after a "pattern of misconduct," a U.S. defense official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on condition of anonymity. The official did not detail the misconduct.\nAlexis appeared to have had sporadic run-ins with the law, dating back to at least 2004 when he was arrested in Seattle, accused of shooting out the tires of a man\'s truck in an anger-fueled "blackout," according to a Seattle Police Department report.\nHe told investigators he believed the man, a construction worker, was mocking him, but had no memory of shooting out the tires, the report said.\nInvestigators later spoke with Alexis\' father, who told police that his son had anger management problems associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, which he suffered after working "as an active participant in rescue attempts" during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York, the report said.\nAnd in 2010, Alexis was arrested by Fort Worth, Texas, police but never charged over an allegation that he fired a gun through the ceiling of his apartment. According to records, he told police he accidentally fired it while cleaning it.\nHis last known address was outside of Fort Worth, where he was roommates for three years with Nutpisit Suthamtewakul, who described Alexis as his best friend.\nThe two were roommates until five months ago, when Suthamtewakul got married and Alexis had to move out.\nHe was having a hard time trying to get on his feet, said Suthamtewakul\'s wife, Kristi. He helped out at the restaurant but not for pay.\n"He was using this as an educational experience to help learn Thai," she said. He enjoyed making deliveries to homes, where the language was spoken. He talked about moving to Thailand.\nShe is grieving. "He was like one of our best friends, like a brother to us and always willing to go out of his way to help us out with things."\nHe was very frustrated with the company that contracted him to work for the Navy, according to another friend.\nIt was unclear whether the dispute was over salary or expenses. Alexis just felt the company owed him money and had not paid him, Ritrovato said.\nBut Ritrovato knew Alexis was fascinated by guns. "He was ... knowledgeable with military rifles and handguns. At least he led us to believe he was. But nobody ever had the idea that he would use them in a derogatory way," he said.

What mania could have compelled the president to take partisan swipes and accuse Republicans of being unpatriotic while police were in the middle of a manhunt after a mass shooting at a naval base just a few miles from the White House?\nWhile Americans wondered if it was a terrorist attack or if there were multiple shooters still on the loose, their president touted again his re-election victory of last year, scoffing at his long-vanquished opponent’s effort to make the election a referendum on Obama’s 2010 health law.\nThe president certainly knew the shooting was taking place and that the manhunt was underway, referencing both in introductory remarks before going into his standard stump speech assailing Republicans in the ongoing budget battle, now in its third year. It had been more three hours since the news broke.\nCritics have complained before about the president’s bad timing: Heading to Las Vegas for a fundraiser while the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya was still smoldering; hitting the golf course with ESPN hosts in the midst of the Syria crisis; etc.\nBut those complaints can at least be partly answered by the fact that the president is the president all of the time. Just as Democrats complained about George W. Bush’s frequent decampments to his Texas ranch, Republicans fume over Obama’s relentless fundraising and golf obsession. But history tells us that it is more about what a president does than where he does it.\nObama did not order a military intervention after the Libya attack. Would his critics have thought his inaction better if he would have been sitting in the Oval Office instead of aboard Air Force One? Unlikely. Would Obama’s backing off on Syria been more palatable if he had not been playing golf with Tony Kornheiser? Doubt it.\nBut when the president chooses to address the public, timing matters. So why was his timing so terrible on Monday? Why did Obama feel the need to attack while thousands of Washington residents and workers were under “shelter in place” orders? What was it about this particular version of the same attack speech Obama has been giving since 2011 that could not wait?\nNothing. And that’s the point.\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney scoffed at the question, saying cancelling the speech wasn’t even considered and that what Obama did was “entirely appropriate” because “time is short.”\nIt’s hard to imagine that time is so short until the Oct. 1 government shutdown deadline that a day’s delay in the speech would have been so damaging, especially because it was so similar to dozens of other addresses the president has given. But in Obamaland, time is always short. In their relentless battle to own every news cycle and keep bulldozing the political press, every second counts.\nThe president has had an almost uniformly bad start to his second term. Scandals, the woe-begotten implementation of his health law, a chaotic unraveling of the once-vaunted “Arab Spring,” the ascendancy of rival nations on the world stage and the intractable partisan standoff in Congress have left Americans skeptical of Obama’s election-year plea to “hold on” just a bit longer to let his agenda work.\n[pullquote]\nIn survival mode and stripped of the political stars who helped the administration stay on offense for the first four years, Team Obama is looking bereft. The result of the White House summit of former political aides who helped the president settle on trying to hang the Syria debacle around the necks of Congressional Republicans suggest that David Axelrod & Co. themselves have lost their chops whilst lolling in MSNBC green rooms and Hoovering up corporate cash on K Street.\nThe old approach of living life on terms set by Politico and TV news means attacking, attacking, attacking and attacking. If you want to “win the day,” you’ve got to be in the day. While the approach long ago turned Obama into wallpaper, ignored through overexposure, it did provide lots of fresh video and soundbites to make sure that the Washington press corps always had something fresh (or at least freshly recycled) from the administration.\nThis manic inability to pause or to even seemingly take a breath has policy consequences. It’s hard to imagine that Obama’s zig-zagging on Syria is influenced by anything so much as an allergy to even a half news cycle of unflattering headlines from a previously doting press. Bad polls, bad press? Must mean it’s bad policy.\nBut now the approach is even losing the support of those to whom Obama is catering. Politico itself today noted that Obama found “tone a challenge.” The same folks who thrilled to every fresh round of partisan bear baiting and nodded approvingly at a president whose political strategy was to explode his rivals now notes that it was unclear “what benefit the White House hoped to reap in launching a major fall offensive in the middle of a national and local tragedy that consumed media attention all day.”\nThe intended benefit was to keep reporters tap, tap, tapping away at their keyboards around Obama’s story line. Obama staged an entire barnstorming tour this summer that seemed substantially aimed at scolding reporters for focusing too much on his scandals and not enough on his call for more government spending, and yet you wonder why he plowed ahead with his debt-limit speech.\nHe was doing it for you, Politico. And this is how you repay him?\nObama seems desperately afraid to allow any news cycle to proceed without being in it somewhere. Whether it was talking to “The Pimp With the Limp” and other local deejays in 2012 or doing a Web interview this year with Zillow, Obama is always there, trying to bulldoze his way through the news cycle.\nThis time, since the story was in the press corps’ backyard, it became all too much. A president whose relentlessness was once considered his cardinal virtue as a subject (and, by extension, a leader) suddenly became distasteful.\nObama will make up for this by being more effusive in the aftermath of the shooting, rightly realizing he has some amends to make. But on Monday, we got a window of the mania that grips this second-term White House: the fear of being ignored.\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

I talk about these sorts of wingnuts (hating 'liberals' makes you a wingnut; being a neo-nazi? Wingnut) being actively delusional and potentially dangerous\nSo here are 2 very current stories here about 2 raving wingnuts who had LOTS of guns and weren't supposed to, posting hit lists on facebook or whatever, STILL openly threatening to kill people.\nGuy #1 is the sort I have been warning you about:\nPolice in Clarkstown, New York have confiscated a cache of high-powered weapons and body armor from a man who was arrested for posting death threats against against many Democratic politicians and every liberal supporter of President Barack Obama.\nWhat did cops do to find this guy? They listened to his landlady when she complained after reading his facebook page.\nMulqueen’s landlady had tipped off police after she found a “hit list” posted on Facebook that threatened Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV), Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY), Rep. Nita Lowey (D-NY) and all members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n***\nNyack-Piermont Patch reported that police searched Mulqueen’s home and found two high-powered rifles, two bayonets, a sword, a knuckle knife, body armor and ammunition. Included in the 100 rounds of ammunition were 27 so-called “tank buster” .50 caliber armor-piercing shells.\nPrevious criminal convictions meant that it was illegal for Mulqueen to possess the weapons.\nSo this guy was not supposed to have guns of any sort to begin with and yet he has the audacity to post a hit list and threaten people.\nThe mind reels.\nWe'll never know if a tragedy was prevented or not: I see little harm in imagining this to be the case.\nGuy #2 is the sort that I expect our government to spy on, since they want to spy on all of us anyway.\nFBI: Neo-Nazi amassed 40,000 rounds, 18 weapons in plot to kill black and Jewish leaders\nA convicted felon and alleged neo-Nazi amassed 40,000 rounds of ammunition and planned to kill black and Jewish community leaders in Detroit as part of a “hit list,” WXYZ-TV reported on Thursday.\nFederal authorities said this week that a search of 47-year-old federal suspect Richard Schmidt’s home revealed the list and apparent plans to kill Scott Kaufman, executive director of the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit, and Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the Detroit chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\n***\nAccording to NBC News, Schmidt was indicted in January 2013 on federal charges of possessing firearms, ammunition and body armor, all of which violated his parole. Schmidt was released from prison in 2003, after 13 years of incarceration in Ohio following a homicide conviction for shooting and killing a man during a traffic stop. Schmidt also wounded two others during that attack.\nInvestigators then found 18 weapons inside Schmidt’s home in Ohio in December 2012, including various types of shotguns and high-caliber rifles, including two different AR-15\nSo we have 2 guys, both clearly fixated on guns, both with prior felonies involving guns and hurting/killing people, amassing caches of weapons and posting hitlists on the intertubes, threatening to kill liberals, Democrats, blacks, the President, and Jews. Both spent time in prison and were released.\nMr. Neo-Nazi is reported as having bought his guns at 'gun shows' where he did not have to deal with background checks. Unsure how Mr. Liberal-Hater got his hardware.\nMr Liberal-Hater is one who feared the government was going to take away his guns.\nHe has nobody to blame but himself.\nAnd losing his guns will be the least of his problems.\nAnd while I am unsure about Mr. Liberal-Hater, I feel more concerned that Mr. Neo-Nazi represents a tragedy averted.

This spring the Supreme Court will wade back into these murky waters, 12 years after it took the death penalty off the table for criminals with mental disabilities but left the details to the states.\nIn its 6-3 decision in Atkins v. Virginia, authored by Justice John Paul Stevens, the court prohibited states from executing anyone with "mental retardation." Mental health professionals define it as substantial limitations in intellectual functions such as reasoning or problem-solving, limitations in adaptive behavior or "street smarts," and evidence of the condition before age 18. (Mental retardation is the term used in law, but most clinicians and The Associated Press refer to the condition as intellectual disability.)\nAfter the decision, most states stuck with the three-pronged clinical definition, but Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas set their own standards. Under Florida\'s law, if you have an IQ over 70, you\'re eligible for execution regardless of intellectual function or adaptive behavior.\nFreddie Lee Hall, who has been on Florida\'s death row for more than 30 years and scored in the mid-70s on IQ tests, is arguing the state\'s standard amounts to unconstitutional punishment.\nMost likely, the case won\'t result in a dramatic shift in national criminal justice policy, but will further clarify who should and should not be eligible for execution, said Ronald Tabak, an attorney who has represented multiple clients with intellectual disabilities and chairs the American Bar Association\'s death penalty committee.\n"There is no reason to think that the court is taking this case because the court loves that Florida is going against the norms of the mental health field," Tabak said. "The more likely reason they granted (judicial review) is …to say there are certain basic things about intellectual disability that you can\'t exclude from consideration."\nThat\'s not the way Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi sees it. The Atkins decision, she wrote in her brief to the Supreme Court, "expressly left the task of defining retardation to the states," and Florida is free to adopt its own standard for determining who is intellectually disabled.\n"Freddie Lee Hall faces a death sentence for the 1978 murder of Karol Hurst, and Florida courts have found that he is not intellectually disabled," said Bondi. "We will urge the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold Hall\'s sentence."\nThe court\'s makeup has shifted since the 2002 Atkins decision. But if the justices split along ideological lines, the vote could favor Hall, assuming that swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy sides with Hall, as he did with Atkins in 2002. Arguments are set for March 3.\nSimilar cases are percolating beyond Florida. In Georgia, death row inmate Warren Hill is fighting execution based on substantial evidence that he is intellectually disabled. In Texas, where the courts use an anecdotal seven-part test largely based on the characteristics of the fictional character Lennie from John Steinbeck\'s novel "Of Mice and Men" to determine intellectual disability, multiple prisoners have been executed in recent years even when they\'ve scored well below 70 on IQ tests.\nLast year, Texas executed Marvin Wilson, who was convicted of murder in 1994, even though he had an IQ of 61. In 2010, Virginia executed Teresa Lewis for her role in a murder-for-hire scheme, even though she had an IQ of 72 and her co-conspirators admitted Lewis did not plan the murder.\nThese are the types of cases advocates want the Supreme Court to revisit. "It\'s our hope that the court will clarify that states must use the clinical definition for intellectual disability…not only for current cases but for future cases, too," said Margaret Nygren, executive director and CEO of the American Association of Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.\nBORDERLINE CASES\nFreddie Lee Hall was convicted of co-planning and carrying out the murder of 21-year-old Karol Hurst in Leesburg, Fla., in 1978. After spending the day scouting the parking lot of a local grocery store with his partner, Mack Ruffin, Hall forced Hurst, who was seven months pregnant, into her car and drove her into the woods. There, Ruffin sexually assaulted and shot Hurst. A jury convicted Hall of first-degree murder for his role in the murder scheme.\nSince Hall was sentenced to death in 1981, he has made multiple appeals based on his low IQ, which varied from 71 to 80 depending on the tests and their margins of error.\n"He has been the same ever since I\'ve known him, and he has the mind of a child," said his attorney, Eric Pinkard, who has been working with Hall since 1999.\nIn multiple hearings to prove his intellectual disability, Hall\'s family and longtime friends testified about Hall\'s struggles with reading, writing and caring for himself and recounted how Hall experienced abuse, starvation and torture as a child. The Florida courts decided that even though Hall had limits in functioning and adaptive behavior, because his IQ scores were not below 70, Hall was not intellectually disabled and could be executed.\nIt\'s these borderline cases where the individual state implementations matter, said Nygren. "Intellectual disability, like genius, is on a continuum," Nygren said. "It\'s challenging for states to legislate that this person is \'in\' or \'out.\'"\nStill, the court shouldn\'t wade too much into the specifics of setting protocols to define intellectual disability, said Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, which advocates for victims of crime.\n"If the Supreme Court gets into issues like these and declares them to be federal constitutional mandates," Scheidegger said, "we will have a long stretch of litigation as the high court resolves one issue after another, never reaching the end."\nMaking that determination is generally subject to clinical judgment, said Nygren. "Clinicians must pick scientifically valid tests that are culturally relevant and standardized, but also individualized," Nygren said. "For instance, if someone\'s been in jail for last five years, it\'s hard to evaluate if they\'re good at managing money since they don\'t have money to manage. That\'s where clinical judgment comes in."\nBeyond IQ tests, the disability manifests in limitations in learning and reasoning, and difficulty with social skills, personal care and language. These factors are just as relevant as an IQ test score, which, said Nygren, "is never going to give you 100 percent (certainty), even though that\'s the expectation placed on the test."\nAdvocates like Nygren want the court to require states to pay more attention to margins of error when determining intellectual disability. Leaving the determination of mental disability to the states, "has given states a lot of leeway to do mischief with the definition of intellectual disability," said Brian Kammer, executive director of the Georgia Resource Center, which provides free legal services for death row inmates.\nFor instance, Georgia requires defendants to prove their intellectual disability "beyond a reasonable doubt," the highest standard of proof in the criminal justice system. Georgia is the only state that requires such a high burden of proof and the legislature is considering lowering the standard in the next legislative session.\nDEATH SENTENCES DOWN\nStill, the Atkins decision has had an impact on executions. At least 98 people have had their death sentence changed since 2002 by proving that they were intellectually disabled, according to data from the Death Penalty Information Center. By their count, in the 18 years before the Atkins decision, at least 44 people who likely suffered from intellectual disabilities were executed.\nNationally, states are carrying out fewer death sentences than they have since the penalty was reinstated in 1976. So far in 2013, 36 people have been executed in nine states. In 2012, 43 people were executed in nine states.\nStateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.

NEW YORK (AP) — The New York City medical examiner's office plans to resume searching for human remains two blocks from the World Trade Center after the sudden discovery of an airplane's landing gear.\nMedical examiner's spokeswoman Ellen Borakove told The Associated Press on Saturday that the alley behind a mosque site will first be tested as part of a standard health and safety evaluation.\nBorakove says sifting for human remains will begin at 8 a.m. Tuesday.\nThe New York Police Department has declared the alley a crime scene, documenting it with photos and restricting access.\nAuthorities say the rusted landing gear is believed to be from a Sept. 11 hijacked plane. Police were guarding the area as a crime scene Saturday.

Zachary Roth at MSNBC asks "will Democrats hold their nerve?"\nA group of younger, progressive senators led by Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Tom Udall of New Mexico has been pushing a package that, among other changes, would require the minority to conduct a “talking filibuster” (think Mr. Smith Goes to Washington), rather than being able to silently object. The overall effect would be to make it harder, both practically and politically, for the GOP to filibuster as a routine means of blocking Democratic legislation. [...]\nReid appeared last fall to embrace the Merkley-Udall approach, which is also backed by Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and a coalition of powerful progressive groups including the Sierra Club, the NAACP, and SEIU. But recent reports suggest Reid is mulling a more modest package of changes which wouldn’t require the talking filibuster, though it would still scrap the filibuster on motions to proceed—that is, to begin debate on a bill—and make it harder in other situations. His possible change of heart comes after lobbying from a group of older senators, who fear the loss of prerogatives for individual senators.\nThere’s little question that the Senate needs to be fixed. [...] Were it not for the filibuster, Democrats could likely have passed a climate-change bill and a healthcare law with a public option during Obama’s first term.\nThe editors at The Register-Guard:\nThe world’s greatest deliberative body is running like a lawnmower that’s been left out all winter: It’s hard to get started, and when it finally comes to life it sputters and kills on even the lowest clumps of grass.\nIt’s time to reform the U.S. Senate’s filibuster rule, which in recent years has fallen prey to rapacious partisanship and cheap tricks by obstructionists who have used the process to block legislation and nominations by requiring a supermajority to proceed.\nFor more on what the pundits are saying about filibuster reform, jump below the fold.\nThe filibuster, a tactic by which a minority party can thwart the Senate majority by endlessly dragging out debate, lately has become all too routine a roadblock in the legislative process. As Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell negotiate over possible reforms, they least they can do is require minority parties to carry out a filibuster threat by speaking on the Senate floor.\nNewsday:\nHistorically filibusters were rare. They should be again. Congress needs fewer obstacles to getting things done.\nDavid Weigel at Slate:\nDemocrats now say that the reform vote will happen “soon”—probably Jan. 23, but let’s not get carried away. The sticking point is a possible compromise, the brainchild of a “Group of Eight” led by Sen. Carl Levin and Sen. John McCain that could attract Republican votes. It wouldn’t give the Democrats everything they want—it wouldn’t force senators to filibuster by actually standing up and talking until their voices or bladders give out. But it would keep Democrats from using the “nuclear option” of a majority vote, and Republicans have sworn holy, unending warfare if the Democrats go there. (Hence the “nuclear” branding. Reformers call this the “constitutional” option, which is not wrong, but opponents say it’ll bring on mutually assured destruction.)\nIt’s the World’s Greatest Deliberative Body engaging in pretty simple game theory. If Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell can’t agree on a reform package, Reid would “move forward” and go nuclear. The diehards, led by Udall and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, keep claiming they have the 51 votes for reform. The most compromise-friendly members of the conference are with them.\nJonathan Krohn at Mother Jones lays out the latest:\nAlthough there is no final proposal in sight, Reid has hinted at the direction he might take by throwing his support behind an idea pushed by Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) that would put the burden on the minority to continue a filibuster. Franken\'s plan would force the group of senators who start a filibuster to rally 41 votes to continue filibustering. This is a heavy burden for the minority; unlike the Udall/Merkley/Harkin "talking filibuster" proposal, it would require all of the filibustering members to be on the floor of the Senate, not just one.\nFranken\'s is far from a full filibuster reform proposal. But the majority party’s reformers seem likely to back Franken\'s idea if it comes up for a vote. Merkley "is supportive of a number of the individual provisions Reid is reportedly considering, particularly" Franken\'s plan, a Merkley aide told Mother Jones. Merkley is "going to keep pushing for a talking filibuster," the aide says, but if that doesn\'t come up for a vote, and a compromise package does, Merkley\'s likely to back Reid.\nThe McCain/Levin plan and the Udall/Merkley/Harkin proposal have three key elements in common: the elimination of the filibuster on motions to proceed, the combination of the three motions related to sending a bill to House-Senate negotiators, and new limits on debate time after the majority wins 60 votes on a bill or nomination. If a compromise does take shape, it\'s likely to be along those lines.\nMeanwhile, over at The Washington Monthly, Sarah Binder looks at reforming the discharge rule in the House:\nFirst, why does the House even have a discharge rule? The rule dates from the 1910 revolt against Speaker Joe Cannon. (That’s Uncle Joe above, in a 1908 Clifford Berryman cartoon drawn from the minority party’s point of view: Cannon is addressing a whole chamber of Cannon look-alikes, Republicans unwilling to challenge their autocratic leader.) After breaking the Speaker’s hold on power in 1910, a cross-party coalition of insurgents crafted a discharge rule to allow a simple majority to pull a bill from committee and to secure a vote on the House floor. Altered a few times along the way, the discharge rule was last changed in 1993, after Ross Perot’s successful campaign to make public the names of discharge petition signers. (Uncle Joe, Ross Perot … Ain’t House procedural history fun?!) In short, the discharge rule emerged from an old battle against the Speaker and provides a tool for launching new ones.\nSwitching tracks, this diary of Gun Appreciation Day by Christopher Evans at The Cleveland Plain-Dealer is depressing and terrifying:\nOutside the entrance, a guy chewed on a cigar stub. His arms cradled a Bushmaster .223 caliber semi-automatic rifle -- the same weapon Adam Lanza used to slaughter 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.\n"How much you want for that?" I asked.\n"Twenty-one [hundred dollars]. Got a laser sight, optical scope and a flare launcher."\n"My buddy here," I said, pointing at Westbrook. "He can go $2,000. But he remains anonymous. No ID."\nThe guy smiled. "Two thousand dollars is enough ID for me," he said.\nHe was what licensed dealers call a "door whore" -- an unlicensed seller who is not required to do a background check or record the sale. He is supposed to demand identification to ensure the buyer is an Ohio resident and 21 years old, but, hey, who\'s paying attention?\nIf you missed this post by our own David Waldman on Gun Appreciation Day from earlier this week, make sure to click through.

What mania could have compelled the president to take partisan swipes and accuse Republicans of being unpatriotic while police were in the middle of a manhunt after a mass shooting at a naval base just a few miles from the White House?\nWhile Americans wondered if it was a terrorist attack or if there were multiple shooters still on the loose, their president touted again his re-election victory of last year, scoffing at his long-vanquished opponent’s effort to make the election a referendum on Obama’s 2010 health law.\nThe president certainly knew the shooting was taking place and that the manhunt was underway, referencing both in introductory remarks before going into his standard stump speech assailing Republicans in the ongoing budget battle, now in its third year. It had been more three hours since the news broke.\nCritics have complained before about the president’s bad timing: Heading to Las Vegas for a fundraiser while the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya was still smoldering; hitting the golf course with ESPN hosts in the midst of the Syria crisis; etc.\nBut those complaints can at least be partly answered by the fact that the president is the president all of the time. Just as Democrats complained about George W. Bush’s frequent decampments to his Texas ranch, Republicans fume over Obama’s relentless fundraising and golf obsession. But history tells us that it is more about what a president does than where he does it.\nObama did not order a military intervention after the Libya attack. Would his critics have thought his inaction better if he would have been sitting in the Oval Office instead of aboard Air Force One? Unlikely. Would Obama’s backing off on Syria been more palatable if he had not been playing golf with Tony Kornheiser? Doubt it.\nBut when the president chooses to address the public, timing matters. So why was his timing so terrible on Monday? Why did Obama feel the need to attack while thousands of Washington residents and workers were under “shelter in place” orders? What was it about this particular version of the same attack speech Obama has been giving since 2011 that could not wait?\nNothing. And that’s the point.\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney scoffed at the question, saying cancelling the speech wasn’t even considered and that what Obama did was “entirely appropriate” because “time is short.”\nIt’s hard to imagine that time is so short until the Oct. 1 government shutdown deadline that a day’s delay in the speech would have been so damaging, especially because it was so similar to dozens of other addresses the president has given. But in Obamaland, time is always short. In their relentless battle to own every news cycle and keep bulldozing the political press, every second counts.\nThe president has had an almost uniformly bad start to his second term. Scandals, the woe-begotten implementation of his health law, a chaotic unraveling of the once-vaunted “Arab Spring,” the ascendancy of rival nations on the world stage and the intractable partisan standoff in Congress have left Americans skeptical of Obama’s election-year plea to “hold on” just a bit longer to let his agenda work.\n[pullquote]\nIn survival mode and stripped of the political stars who helped the administration stay on offense for the first four years, Team Obama is looking bereft. The result of the White House summit of former political aides who helped the president settle on trying to hang the Syria debacle around the necks of Congressional Republicans suggest that David Axelrod & Co. themselves have lost their chops whilst lolling in MSNBC green rooms and Hoovering up corporate cash on K Street.\nThe old approach of living life on terms set by Politico and TV news means attacking, attacking, attacking and attacking. If you want to “win the day,” you’ve got to be in the day. While the approach long ago turned Obama into wallpaper, ignored through overexposure, it did provide lots of fresh video and soundbites to make sure that the Washington press corps always had something fresh (or at least freshly recycled) from the administration.\nThis manic inability to pause or to even seemingly take a breath has policy consequences. It’s hard to imagine that Obama’s zig-zagging on Syria is influenced by anything so much as an allergy to even a half news cycle of unflattering headlines from a previously doting press. Bad polls, bad press? Must mean it’s bad policy.\nBut now the approach is even losing the support of those to whom Obama is catering. Politico itself today noted that Obama found “tone a challenge.” The same folks who thrilled to every fresh round of partisan bear baiting and nodded approvingly at a president whose political strategy was to explode his rivals now notes that it was unclear “what benefit the White House hoped to reap in launching a major fall offensive in the middle of a national and local tragedy that consumed media attention all day.”\nThe intended benefit was to keep reporters tap, tap, tapping away at their keyboards around Obama’s story line. Obama staged an entire barnstorming tour this summer that seemed substantially aimed at scolding reporters for focusing too much on his scandals and not enough on his call for more government spending, and yet you wonder why he plowed ahead with his debt-limit speech.\nHe was doing it for you, Politico. And this is how you repay him?\nObama seems desperately afraid to allow any news cycle to proceed without being in it somewhere. Whether it was talking to “The Pimp With the Limp” and other local deejays in 2012 or doing a Web interview this year with Zillow, Obama is always there, trying to bulldoze his way through the news cycle.\nThis time, since the story was in the press corps’ backyard, it became all too much. A president whose relentlessness was once considered his cardinal virtue as a subject (and, by extension, a leader) suddenly became distasteful.\nObama will make up for this by being more effusive in the aftermath of the shooting, rightly realizing he has some amends to make. But on Monday, we got a window of the mania that grips this second-term White House: the fear of being ignored.\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.

New NBC poll confirms an early reality check on 2016: 1) GOP remains divided… 2) Dem Party is pretty unified around Hillary Clinton… And 3) Democrats continue to benefit from the same demographic trends that helped Obama in ’08 and ’12… What’s more, the media (see the New Republic piece) appear more eager for a Dem challenger to Hillary than Democrats are (see our NBC poll)… Pro-Hillary Super PAC holds finance meeting in New York… WSJ: Fewer than 50,000 have enrolled in the federal health-care exchange… And Herring now leads Obenshain by a mere 117 votes in the VA AG race.\nHillary Clinton at the Pennsylvania Conference For Women in Philadelphia on Nov. 1, 2013.\n*** A reality check on 2016: Yes, it’s early. And yes, 2008 taught us that the early front-runners (Clinton and Giuliani) don’t always end up as the presidential nominees. But our new NBC News poll looking ahead to the 2016 presidential election reconfirms three current political realities. One, the Republican Party is divided. According to the poll, 32% of Republican and Republican-leaning respondents say they would vote for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in a GOP presidential primary, while 31% prefer another Republican candidate (never mind the other third who are undecided, so together 68% of GOPers are not on board with Christie). Two, the Democratic Party is pretty unified. By comparison in the poll, 66% of Democratic or Democratic-leaning respondents say they’d back Hillary Clinton in a presidential primary, versus just 14% who say they’d vote for another Democratic candidate (and 34% total who claim not to be for Hillary yet). And three, Democrats continue to benefit from demographic trends that will be difficult for the GOP to overcome in 2016 -- and beyond. In a hypothetical matchup between Clinton and Christie, the poll finds the former Democratic secretary of state getting the support of 44% of all adults, while the Republican governor gets 34%. You might not think you need a poll to tell you these things, but a poll certainly helps to reinforce them.\nRamesh Ponnuru and Ruth Marcus discuss a potential Hillary Clinton 2016 run against Rep. Gov. Chris Christie and whether Elizabeth Warren may enter the race.\n*** Christie vs. a generic Republican: As mentioned above, our poll shows Republicans split over Christie: 32% would back him in a GOP primary, versus 31% who would support another Republican candidate. And it’s instructive to study the crosstabs to see where Christie over-performs and under-performs here. He over-performs among women (35%), minorities (46%), seniors (48%), and people in the Northeast (57%) -- you know, the folks who don’t dominate Republican primaries! But he under-performs among men (28%); Republicans ages 18-29, a la the Rand Paul crowd (15%); upper-income Republicans (26%); and residents in the Midwest (30%), South (27%), and West (22%) – or the Republicans who DO DOMINATE Republican primaries. This geographical divide is especially striking -- 57% support in the Northeast, but just 27% in the South and 22% in the West.\n*** Clinton vs. a generic Democrat: It’s equally instructive to see where Clinton over-performs against another Democrat. She gets 70% among females, 70% among whites, 71% among seniors, 72% among the lowest-income Democrats, and 73% in the Northeast and 70% in the Midwest. Where she underperforms is among men (62%), college grads (62%), and 60% among upper-income Democrats – these are the remnants of Obama’s white coalition in the ’08 Democratic race. But a reality check here: She’s still getting SIXTY PERCENT among these folks, which suggests there isn’t really a substantial opening for another Democratic candidate (whether it’s Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, or anyone else). Remember, in 2005, there was some real Clinton fatigue among Democrats that provided the opening for Obama. That’s not the evidence right now.\n*** Demography continues to be destiny: As for our hypothetical general-election matchup between Clinton and Christie, Hillary is benefitting from the same demographic trends that helped President Obama win election in 2008 and re-election in 2012. She leads Christie among African Americans (83%-4%), respondents ages 18 to 29 (45%-31%), and Latinos (44%-33%). Clinton also holds the advantage with residents from the Northeast (52%-35%), West (43%-30%), the South (43%-35%) and Midwest (41%-37%). And she has a narrow edge among independents (39%-35%). Christie, meanwhile, leads among whites (41%-37%), seniors (44%-41%), and respondents with the highest incomes (46%-34%). Just what Republicans want to hear: They are the part of old rich white people? (By the way, see today’s new L.A. Times poll of Californians, which should be a wakeup call to GOP officials nationally.) Folks, these numbers are pretty similar to the splits we saw between Obama and Romney in 2012. And the downside of being the ELECTABILITY candidate for Republicans? You better be leading (or close to it) against Clinton, and you better be performing better among particular demographic groups than Romney did. Right now, Christie isn’t doing either.\n*** Press appears to be more eager for a Dem challenger to Hillary than Democrats are: The political story that went viral yesterday was the New Republic piece on Elizabeth Warren and whether she might challenge Hillary Clinton in 2016 -- despite Hillary’s numbers we mentioned above. From the article: “In addition to being strongly identified with the party’s populist wing, any candidate who challenged Clinton would need several key assets. The candidate would almost certainly have to be a woman, given Democrats’ desire to make history again. She would have to amass huge piles of money with relatively little effort. Above all, she would have to awaken in Democratic voters an almost evangelical passion. As it happens, there is precisely such a person. Her name is Elizabeth Warren.” But here is the potential danger for Clinton: The political press corps appears to be MORE EAGER to search for a challenger for Clinton than Democrats are -- just see our poll.\n*** About that pro-Hillary Super PAC: There’s one more piece of 2016 news worth mentioning today. “On Tuesday, [former Obama top aide Mitch] Stewart and a dozen or so other political operatives and 170 donors will gather in New York to plot how to help Mrs. Clinton win in 2016. The meeting is the first national finance council strategy meeting of Ready for Hillary, a ‘super PAC’ devoted to building a network to support Mrs. Clinton’s potential presidential ambitions,” the New York Times writes. Folks, it will be interesting to look through the Ready for Hillary FEC report when it comes out. Which consultants are making money?\n*** Paper: Fewer than 50,000 have enrolled in the federal exchange: Turning from 2016 to the troubled Obamacare rollout, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that fewer than 50,000 people “had successfully navigated the troubled federal health-care website and enrolled in private insurance plans as of last week, two people familiar with the matter said, citing internal government data. The figure is a fraction of the Obama administration\'s target of 500,000 enrollees for October.” But three caveats worth noting: 1) the 50,000 figure doesn’t include those who signed up via the better-running state websites, 2) it doesn’t include those who received insurance via expanded Medicaid, and 3) the administration always assumed most people would purchase their insurance in December, given that the insurance doesn’t take effect until Jan. 1. And the fact that the federal exchange is behind schedule shouldn’t surprise anyone. The website, after all, hasn’t been working. As one health insurer told the Journal: "Given the problems we have witnessed and experienced, that [40,000 to 50,000] number is actually higher than I expected."\n*** Herring now leads Obenshain in the VA AG race by 117 votes: And lastly, in the final undecided race from Election Day 2013, it appears that Democrat Mark Herring has taken the lead over Republican Mark Obenshain in Virginia’s thisclose race for attorney general. The Washington Post: “Herring had started the day trailing his Republican opponent … by a mere 17 votes out of 2.2 million cast. But as jurisdictions across the state continued to scrub their vote counts, the State Board of Elections showed Herring with a 117-vote lead late Monday.” More from the Post: “Local jurisdictions have until Tuesday at 6 p.m. to report their results to the State Board of Elections. The state then is scheduled to certify the results on Nov. 25. If the margin is less than 1 percent, either candidate can request a recount. If the margin is less than 0.5 percent, the state will pay for the recount.” And it certainly looks like we’re headed for a recount.\nClick here to sign up for First Read emails.\nText FIRST to 622639, to sign up for First Read alerts to your mobile phone.\nCheck us out on Facebook and also on Twitter.

26 students from Sandy Hook will sing before kickoff\nNFL to fly families to New Orleans later this week\nLeague%2C players have shown extensive support to victims in wake of shooting\nNEW ORLEANS — A little more than a month after the tragic mass shooting of 26 students and faculty at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., a group of 26 students from the school will perform America the Beautiful during the Super Bowl XLVII pregame show, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed to USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday.\nThe league is flying the students and their families down to New Orleans later this week in advance of the performance, which will be broadcast live on CBS shortly before Alicia Keys performs the National Anthem.\nThe gesture will cap a season in which the league lent its support to the Newtown community via "S.H.E.S." stickers on helmets, personal messages on cleats and gloves, moments of silence before games and charitable donations for relief causes, as well other means of emotional support.\nThe New York Giants welcomed students and families onto the field during their pregame introductions before their Week 17 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. That came a little less than two weeks after Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz paid an emotional visit to the family of 6-year-old Jack Pinto, a Cruz fan who was buried in a No. 80 Giants jersey.\n"It was a time where I just wanted to be a positive voice, a positive light in a time where it can be very negative. It was a good time," Cruz said of his visit with the Pinto family. "They\'re a great family and they are really united right now at this time. It was good to see."\nPHOTOS: NFL\'s tributes to Sandy Hook victims\nTennessee Titans running back Chris Johnson auctioned off his game-worn cleats on which he wrote all of the victims\' names and gave the proceeds to the United Way\'s Sandy Hook School Support Fund.\nThe Houston Texans were one of the teams that raised money for the victims. Defensive end J.J. Watt tweeted a picture of him and a handful of students on the field the Friday before Houston\'s Week 16 game against the Indianapolis Colts.\n"I just kind of wanted to give them as normal a day as possible, just running around, having fun, going out on the field," Watt told USA TODAY Sports. "We were kicking field goals. They were trying to put it through the uprights. Just be kids. And to see them in a normal setting, having fun and big smiles on their faces was awesome."\nA group of Sandy Hook students recently recorded a version of Over the Rainbow with pop singer Ingrid Michaelson at the home of Connecticut residents Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, with the proceeds going to Newtown Youth Academy and the United Way of Western Connecticut.\n***

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama on Saturday praised the nation\'s police officers for everyday acts of courage, saying they often rush into danger to do "some really tough stuff."\nIn a White House ceremony honoring some of the bravest, he said America need look no further than the Boston Marathon bombings to know what police are made of: "Police officers ... running towards explosions not knowing if there was something more on the way. Law enforcement from different agencies in different parts of the country working together as one united team to identify suspects and bring them to justice."\nHe said few will ever forget the end of the marathon manhunt in Watertown, Mass. Suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a gunbattle with police, and residents cheered and gave police high fives after his brother Dzhokhar was apprehended.\n"We don\'t always get that opportunity to stand and applaud the men and women who keep us safe," Obama said. "But they\'re out there — hundreds of thousands of you patrolling our streets every single day. And we know that when we need you most, you\'ll be ready to dash into danger, to protect our lives, even if it means putting your lives on the line."\nObama was flanked by award recipients, many in uniform, with families, friends and other officers looking on from the audience in the East Room.\nThe annual ceremony honored 43 law enforcement officers who are recipients of the National Association of Police Organizations TOP COPS award.\nThe group included eight officers from the Oak Creek, Wis., police force who battled a gunman at a Sikh temple last Aug. 5. The gunman killed six people before turning his weapon on himself. Obama singled out Brian Murphy, the first to arrive, who, he said, suffered 12 bullet wounds.\nHe also singled out New York police Detective Ivan Marcano, who was off duty in the Bronx with his girlfriend when he saw muggers attack a cab driver. Obama recounted Marcano being shot inches from his heart yet still giving chase to the suspects — holding his wound with one hand and his weapon with the other. Obama had Marcano\'s girlfriend stand, saying, "This was his date night! It\'s unbelievable."

A Mississippi man scheduled to be put to death on Tuesday was granted a stay of execution by the State Supreme Court, after the United States Department of Justice sent lawyers and officials involved in the case several letters disavowing the degree of certainty expressed by F.B.I. forensic experts at the man’s trial.\nAbout 2 p.m., just four hours before the scheduled execution, the court voted 8 to 1 to grant a reprieve “until further order” to Willie Jerome Manning, 44, who was convicted in 1994 of murdering two college students.\nThe justices in favor did not explain their reasoning or put a time limit on the reprieve. The dissenting justice issued a blistering objection, saying Mr. Manning had exhausted the challenges to his conviction and attacking the Justice Department for the letters, along with several other unrelated issues.\nStarting Thursday, the Justice Department sent three letters calling certain aspects of the trial testimony of two F.B.I. experts “erroneous.” Defense lawyers cited these letters as reasons to put off the execution until DNA tests could be conducted on crime scene evidence, including a rape kit, a request that Mr. Manning had made unsuccessfully several times before.\nThe state attorney general, Jim Hood, denied the requests, saying that there was “overwhelming evidence of guilt” and that the letters did not repudiate the testimony of the F.B.I. experts, but only made some clarifications.\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, Mr. Hood said his office had filed a report with the court stating that the rape kit, along with some other physical evidence, was not found to have biological residue that could be tested for DNA.\nLawyers for the Innocence Project, who are helping Mr. Manning’s defense, said that in more than a dozen exoneration cases in the past, DNA samples had been found in rape kits years or even decades after the samples initially tested negative for any biological evidence.\nImage\nThe Justice Department letters offered to make the F.B.I. available to conduct DNA testing on hair fragments found at the scene.\nMany involved in the case, as well as outside legal experts, said they could not recall the Justice Department’s sending such letters in the last few days before an execution.\n“I think the term is ‘unprecedented,’ ” said Forrest Allgood, the original prosecutor.\nIn December 1992, Jon Steckler and Tiffany Miller were found killed. A token found at the crime scene appeared to be among several items stolen from a car that same night, items that Mr. Manning was later found to have been trying to sell.\nOther than hair fragments found in Ms. Miller’s car, little forensic evidence was presented at trial. One witness testified that Mr. Manning had confessed to the murders while in jail, though defense lawyers said the witness’s account was inconsistent with known facts.\nAnother witness, a former girlfriend, said she had once seen Mr. Manning firing a gun into a tree. An F.B.I. firearms expert testified that bullets found in the tree had been fired from the same gun as the bullets used in the murders.\nA letter sent by the Justice Department late Monday said a firearms expert could not testify that “a specific gun fired a specific bullet to the exclusion of all other guns in the world.”\n“The examiner could testify to that information, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, but not absolutely,” the letter read.\nMr. Allgood, the prosecutor, said he believed the distinction, “quite frankly, is semantics.”\nIt was not the only testimony the Justice Department expressed reservations about. In two previous letters, federal officials challenged a separate F.B.I. expert’s analysis of hair fragments, saying the expert could not have determined that the hairs were from an African-American, as he testified. An expert could say only that a hair fragment “possesses certain traits that are associated” with a racial group, the letter said.

JOINT BASE LEWIS-McCHORD, Wash. — Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales pleaded guilty Wednesday to the slaying of 16 Afghan civilians in 2012, telling a military judge, "Sir, as far as why: I\'ve asked that question a million times since then. There\'s not a good reason in this world for why I did the horrible things I did."\nThe judge, Col. Jeffery Nance, accepted the plea, ensuring that Bales will avoid the death penalty.\nA jury will decide in August whether he will be sentenced to life in prison with or without the possibility of parole.\nBales, 39, entered the plea to premeditated murder and other charges. Nance explained Bales\' rights and asked if he understood them. Bales stood and answered, "Yes, sir, I do."\nBales, dressed in full uniform, was alert and spoke in a confident voice as he answered the judge\'s questions, surrounded by six friends and family.\nDefense attorneys John Henry Browne and Emma Scanlan said after the hearing that Bales is seeking a sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole after 10 years.\n"There is no death penalty on the table, and there is the opportunity for life with parole,\'\' Browne said. "We never thought we\'d get there.\'\'\nBales told the judge he had been drinking contraband alcohol, snorting Valium and taking steroids before the attack. He was serving his fourth tour in a combat zone. The allegations against him raised questions about the toll multiple deployments take on U.S. servicemembers.\nBales told the court that he had been taking the steroids to improve his fitness and that they "definitely increased my irritability and anger.\'\'\nThe steroid, stanozolol, is a class three controlled substance. Bales was taking it without a prescription or authorization.\nThe Ohio native and father of two from Lake Tapps, Wash., was charged with 16 counts of premeditated murder in the shootings or stabbings of mostly women and children. He was accused of slipping away from his remote southern Afghanistan outpost at Camp Belambay early March 11, 2012, and attacking mud-walled compounds in two nearby villages.\nBales described one of the killings, saying he "went to the nearby village of Alkozai. While inside a compound in Alkozai, I observed a female I now know to be Na\'ikmarga. I formed the intent to kill Na\'ikmarga, and I did kill Na\'ikmarga by shooting her with a firearm. This act was without legal justification, sir."\nNine of the victims, five women and four men, were shot first, and their bodies were burned.\n"I remember there being a lantern in the room,\'\' Bales told the judge. "I remember there being a fire after that situation, and I remember coming back ... with matches in my pocket." He said he did not remember throwing the lantern on the bodies, but "I have seen the pictures, and it\'s the only thing that makes sense. "\nAfter killing four people in the first village, he returned to his base, then went out again, he said. When the judge asked him what he expected to do, he said he expected to find people and, "Sir, I expected to kill them. "\nBales is with the Army\'s 2nd Battalion, 3rd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team.\nJoint Base Lewis-McChord is an amalgamation of the Army\'s Fort Lewis and the Air Force\'s McChord Air Force Base. It supports more than 40,000 active-duty Guard and Reserve servicemembers. Bales worked on the base and lived about 30 miles west of it.\nContributing: William M.

The Senate will vote Thursday on whether to bring gun bills to the floor\n14 Republicans say they plan to block votes on gun bills\nIt is unclear whether there are 60 votes in the Senate to end the filibuster\nWASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that beginning Thursday, the Senate will hold votes on gun control — with or without a Republican filibuster.\nAs a bipartisan compromise proved elusive, Reid scheduled a vote to end debate on Thursday. Even if he falls short of the 60 votes needed to end debate, he said he\'ll make Republicans filibuster the bill until he gets a vote. "It will take a little bit of time, but we\'re going to do it," he said.\n"We need to move to this legislation … and let the cards fall where they may," he told reporters following a closed-door Democratic meeting.\nReid\'s action starts the clock on what will be the most intense debate on gun control since the 1994 crime bill. But even now, the exact shape of the legislation is very much undefined.\nMore than an hour after a 5 p.m. target for a compromise on criminal background checks for gun purchases, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., emerged from the majority leader\'s office without a Plan B.\n"We\'re closer than we\'ve ever been," Schumer said.\n"These have all been great talks," Manchin said.\nThe compromise Manchin was trying to forge with Sen. Pat Toomey, the Republican from the neighboring Appalachian state of Pennsylvania, will have to come Wednesday — if it comes at all. They\'re working on a plan to expand background checks and close the "gun show loophole."\nOther amendments in the works: A mental health provision by Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, language regulating the size of ammunition magazines by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein\'s ban on certain types of assault weapons.\nIt\'s not clear whether there are 60 votes to end debate, and Reid conceded he didn\'t know, either. Several Republican senators have indicated they will vote with Democrats to end the filibuster and allow an up-or-down vote on the gun bill.\nSen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., said on MSNBC Tuesday "I don\'t support a filibuster for this," and Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said on CBS that although it was still unclear what would be in the bill, "I think it deserves a vote up or down."\nOther Republican senators who have expressed reservations about a filibuster include John McCain of Arizona and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.\nSen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., wouldn\'t say outright whether he would support the Republican filibuster Tuesday, saying the final bill had not yet been released.\n"I\'ll be anxious to see what the actual gun legislation looks like when Sen. Reid finally is ready to bring it to the floor and whether it has amendments on it or not," he said. "But as a general principle, I believe it\'s always better to debate the bill."\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, had a similar answer, telling reporters that he hadn\'t seen the final bill.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he welcomed a debate on the issue. "I will vote to proceed with the bill if I get assurances that we can offer meaningful amendments," he said. "I don\'t fear the debate; I welcome the debate. That\'s just me."\nVice President Biden said Tuesday that the prospect of a Republican filibuster was "mind-boggling" and said the issue "isn\'t going away."\nBut Reid may not have all his Democratic votes, either. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., is ill and will not be in the Senate this week to vote, and at least two leading Democrats, Sens. Max Baucus of Montana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas, have not said whether they will support Reid\'s effort to move to the gun bill. Pryor confirmed to reporters Tuesday that he hadn\'t decided on whether to vote to proceed on the gun bill.\n"I don\'t get all the Democrats all the time," Reid said. "That\'s for sure."\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, defended the filibuster. "In my view, every senator has a responsibility to actively protect the Bill of Rights," he said. "Any bill that would undermine the Bill of Rights, in my view, should be subject to a 60-vote threshold."\nBut he deflected questions on whether he had enough senators to block a vote, or whether Tea Party-allied senators would take to the floor in a "talking filibuster," such as the one Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., conducted last month on President Obama\'s nominee to head the CIA.\n"I would be happy spending the next two or three weeks on the floor of the Senate debating this," Cruz said. "There\'s an irony to the calls for \'Let\'s have a debate.\' We\'re having the debate right now."\nContributing: Aamer Madhani

If the facts don't matter- what's the point. It just turns into a bunch of name calling and belittling. If you say anything you are part of the problem - if you don't say anything you are part of the problem. As long as one side refuses to listen to the other, we will be at a stalemate and nothing will be achieved.\nThe North Koreans proved this in the 50s by dragging the war out for an extra year while they complained about the shape of the 'peace' table. The Russians proved it in the 60s by vetoing every proposal put forward by the US or Britain and creating a situation where nuclear war almost came to pass. Things changed in the 70s - countries started paying lip service to the rest of the world while actually continuing on with what ever they were doing in the first place. In the 90s through today - it was muddy the waters so much and spout so much rhetoric that nobody knew what the hell was being said or what is going on.\nNow we have politicians and celebrities jumping on every band wagon that comes down the pipe. Don't actually condemn any action or activity until you see which way the wind is blowing- even if you disagree. Unless its so blatant it can't be ignored you don't have to chastise or condemn anyone for anything. As a matter of fact, let's ignore every problem at home. We'll concentrate on the rest of the world in stead and say 'tsk-tsk' about what's happening 'over there'.\nPeople are poor in America and can't earn a living wage. Tough. I'd make products in the good ol' US of A if people didn't bitch about paying an extra buck for a pair of pants. It doesn't matter that a celebrity can have some kid die while making a 99cent T-shirt they sell for $150.00 as long as people are dumb enough to buy a million of them. If products were made in The States again they may cost a bit more but there would be a hell of a lot more jobs for young people beyond the fast food industry.

No question asks. If you want to argue that point, I will only give you that probably extreme white supremacist that does not value his life couldn\'t care less.</p>\n<p>This case was very complex because in reality we do not have perpetrator, we do not have criminal.<strong> We have two completely innocent individuals</strong>. But for you to see that you need to take the prejudices off the equation and that is too challenging for some people if they already have formed an opinion.</p>\n<p>If you followed closely the trial you will find out that when Zimmerman made the call he was not even sure what color the young man was. Operator asked him the race &amp; he stated &quot;I think black &ldquo;So there it goes the first false accusation that he picked TM because he was black. So he could had been Hispanic, or white for all he knew when he started to follow him.</p>\n<p>The ill will and hatred was not the reason for him following him. Nobody knows what this man has in his heart. His main intention was to help police get the person he thought <strong>(wrongly)</strong> that was up to no good. Need to understand that perceiving someone as acting suspicious is not a crime. The wrong assumption was a mistake and this kind of misinterpretation of actions can happen to everybody no matter what color of your skin. Police do it all the time, even guards at shopping malls. If you are near small items and feel the need to scratch your butt you already raise some red flags. It is human!</p>\n<p>The thing is that once they confronted each other thing went out of control and it became a case of self-defense. All the evidence and witnesses draw a picture of what actually happened and given deep deliberation of all the evidence Zim was found not guilty.</p>\n<p>Race was not issue here, giving same circumstances with other people with different skin color jurors would had no choice but to rule the same way.

Nor do i think this was a clear and cut case either. I was questioning what Georges intentions were, But when Al Sharptonshowed up it killed any credibility for the parents or Tyron.. I for one don\'t forget what AL has done to others in the passed with his if it is not black it is not right attitude. I still think that George was not in the complete right in this case but Al did not help the prosecutor by any means. Al Sharpton credibility is in the negative and soon as he shows his face any where i don\'t take any thing he says seriosly.\n\nWHo do you turn to....Not sure but Al Sharpton reminds me in many ways of David Duke. I don\'t like either of the race hating bastards....\n\n\n \n   Reply   Share   \nReport  \n \n\nQuantumfall \n #1343.2 \n\n\nI think every parent in the USA that has a young son felt the same thing that the black community felt. No question asks. If you want to argue that point, I will only give you that probably extreme white supremacist that does not value his life couldn\'t care less.\nThis case was very complex because in reality we do not have perpetrator, we do not have criminal. We have two completely innocent individuals. But for you to see that you need to take the prejudices off the equation and that is too challenging for some people if they already have formed an opinion.\nIf you followed closely the trial you will find out that when Zimmerman made the call he was not even sure what color the young man was. Operator asked him the race & he stated "I think black “So there it goes the first false accusation that he picked TM because he was black. So he could had been Hispanic, or white for all he knew when he started to follow him.\nThe ill will and hatred was not the reason for him following him. Nobody knows what this man has in his heart. His main intention was to help police get the person he thought (wrongly) that was up to no good. Need to understand that perceiving someone as acting suspicious is not a crime. The wrong assumption was a mistake and this kind of misinterpretation of actions can happen to everybody no matter what color of your skin. Police do it all the time, even guards at shopping malls. If you are near small items and feel the need to scratch your butt you already raise some red flags. It is human!\nThe thing is that once they confronted each other thing went out of control and it became a case of self-defense. All the evidence and witnesses draw a picture of what actually happened and given deep deliberation of all the evidence Zim was found not guilty.\nRace was not issue here, giving same circumstances with other people with different skin color jurors would had no choice but to rule the same way. You can\'t rule out reasonable doubt that Zimmerman was fighting for his life! PERIOD.\nI see as irresponsible for people to vilify this person as a racist because he was white. (That is the whole basis for calling him racist) If he was black, the case would have gone under the table. (Funny was that they find out that he actually was a minority but the racist horn was sounded already and media and leaders went along with it).

"We stand on shoulders of untold millions," he said.\n“But for them,” Holder added later, referencing King and his allies, “I would not be attorney general of the United States, and Barack Obama would not be president of the United States.”\nHe reiterated earlier criticisms of the Supreme Court’s ruling on the Voting Rights Act — a topic that quickly emerged as one of Saturday’s focal points.\n“This morning, we affirm that struggle must and will go on until every eligible American has a chance to exercise his or her right to vote," said Holder, who on Thursday sued Texas over a strict voter ID law.\nNewark Mayor Cory Booker, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Md.) urged activists to advocate for equality and fairness, placing recent social debates in the context of King’s vision.\n“Many of our people still inhabit islands of poverty, are incapable of finding good jobs, have no voice in our democracy, because they are told they have no valid ID,” Hoyer said.\nBooker, 44, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, called on young people to carry King\'s torch.\n"Me and my generation cannot now afford to sit back consuming all of our blessings, getting dumb, fat and happy thinking we have achieved our freedoms," Booker said.\nHouse Minority Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, says Dr. Martin Luther King would want people to celebrate his legacy "by acting upon his agenda, by realizing the dream."\nU.S. Rep John Lewis (D-Ga.), one of the pillars of King’s movement and the youngest speaker at the 1963 march, pressed the crowd to “fight the good fight” for freedom.\nHe energized spectators with a chant: “You’ve got to stand up, speak up, speak out, and get in the way! Make some noise!”\nPresident Obama called Lewis, the last surviving speaker from the 1963 march, "a couple days ago," according to a senior administration official, adding that Obama is a "student of history" who thought the congressman would help him understand "the feeling of the moment."\nRhonda Hearns, 50, a physician from Prince George\'s County, Md., who will attend the march, said matters such as voting rights, equal pay and discrimination show that there are many unresolved issues remaining.\n“I feel very honored to be able to attend this commemoration 50 years later, but it also stirs up a lot of emotion because we still have so far to go," Hearns said.\n"It’s still very important for people to show up and march again,” she added. “Just a peaceful demonstration, like what Dr. Martin Luther King would have wanted."\nWashington, D.C., in the summer of 1963, was more than a little nervous about the prospect of a big civil rights march coming to the city. That worry extended from the president on down -- a fear that if it went badly, it could derail the efforts to pass the nation\'s most important civil rights law.\nCivil rights organizations, organized labor, the LGBT community and women\'s rights groups were all richly represented in the gathering.\nAmong the organizations participating in the march Saturday are: National Urban League, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, American Federation of Teachers, Human Rights Campaign, Lawyers\' Committee for Civil Rights, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, National Black Justice Coalition, Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Service Employees International Union.\nUnemployment, health care and education are issues that brought Yvette Young to the march. The 52-year-old Virginia resident and vice president at the Urban League of Hampton Roads hopes her daughter, 14, will have a better life than she did.\n"My life hasn\'t been so bad, but I grew up in the 60s," Young said, adding that she had to witness a lot of discrimination. "I hope for a much better road for her," she added.\nThe organization is convening the event along with a range of civic, labor and business sponsors, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\nSharpton and King III were joined Saturday by relatives of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old boy who was abducted, beaten and shot in the head in 1955 in Mississippi after he was accused of flirting with a white woman, organizers said in a press release.\nKeystone / Getty Images\nParticipants in the March on Washington fill the space between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument on Aug. 28, 1963.\nThe so-called “Realize the Dream” march, which will cut a symbolic half-mile path from the Lincoln Memorial to the King Memorial, will also feature remarks from Attorney General Eric Holder, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., according to the release.\nThe march and rally will be followed by the “Let Freedom Ring” commemoration and call to action on Wednesday — marking exactly 50 years since King drew more than 200,000 to the Lincoln Memorial and delivered his groundbreaking “I Have A Dream” speech.\nKing\'s address is widely credited with spurring the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act.\nYoung said the events of 1963 carried a deep meaning for her.\n“I always wished that I could’ve been a part of it," she said. "Tomorrow gives me a chance to be a part of it. It’s 50 years later, but I’ll be there.”\nSpeakers at the Wednesday observance will include President Barack Obama and former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, according to the event’s website.\nObama\'s speech will center on the progress that has been made since the 1963 march as well as his vision for the future, according to a senior administration official.\nKristen Welker and Grace Bello of NBC News, as well as The Associated Press, contributed to this report.\nNBC chief education correspondent Rehema Ellis talks to Cincinnati children aged 12 to 16 about the impact of Dr. Martin Luther King\'s historic "I have a dream" speech. "We can all play together, drink the same water, and go to the same water fountain," says one, while another says he would thank Dr. King "because I appreciate all the things he has done for us."\nThis story was originally published on Sun Aug 25, 2013 11:13 AM EDT\nPopular Discussio

Larry Downing / Reuters\nPresident Barack Obama speaks about the Trayvon Martin case in the press briefing room at the White House in Washington, July 19, 2013.\nPresident Barack Obama made a surprise appearance at the White House Friday to discuss African-Americans\' reaction to last weekend\'s verdict in the George Zimmerman case, saying that "Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago."\n"You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African- American community at least, there\'s a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it\'s important to recognize that the African- American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that -- that doesn\'t go away," he said.\nMaking a surprise appearance in the White House press room, President Obama discusses his views on the Trayvon Martin verdict, and how it feels as an African American to have these "inescapable" experiences.\nObama addressed the issue personally as well, saying, “There are very few African-American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they are shopping at a department store. And that includes me.”\nHe recalled his own experiences before becoming a nationally-recognized politician, noting, “There are very few African- American men who haven’t had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me, at least before I was a senator. There are very few African-Americans who haven’t had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off.”\nAnd he contended that these attitudes often shape perceptions in the United States.\n“I don\'t want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida and it\'s inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear,” he said.\nAsked if the president had thoroughly contemplated his remarks, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said, “I don’t think there’s any question, and you can judge by what he just said and how he said it, he knows what he thinks and he knows what he feels, and he had not just in the past week but for a good portion of his life given a lot of thought to these issues.”\nObama also suggested that the outcome of the case could have been different if Martin were white. "If a white male teen would have been involved in this scenario," he said, "both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different."\nThe president also nodded to the Justice Department investigation which is probing whether or not to bring federal civil rights charges against Zimmerman. But Obama also urged state and local officials to review their own procedures to see how to improve their law enforcement practices.\nHe also called for a review of so-called "Stand Your Ground" laws, a central issue in the case.\n"If Trayvon Martin was of age and was armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk?" Obama asked. "If the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, then it seems to me that we should examine those laws."\nObama said he wanted to "reiterate what I said on Sunday, which is there are going to be a lot of arguments about the legal issues in the case. I\'ll let all the legal analysts and talking heads address those issues."\nIn his first public remarks after the acquittal by a Florida court of Travyon Martin\'s shooter, George Zimmerman, President Obama says, "Trayvon Martin could have been me, 35 years ago."\nThe president added, "The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner. The prosecution and the defense made their arguments. The jurors were properly instructed that in a case such as this, reasonable doubt was relevant and they rendered a verdict. And once the jury\'s spoken, that\'s how our system works."\nAnd though Obama sidestepped the idea of demanding a new, national conversation on race -- and while he said that racism was far from eliminated -- the president ended on an upbeat moment, expressing his view that race relations are "getting better."\n"I don’t want us to lose sight that things are getting better. Each successive generation seems to be making progress in changing attitudes when it comes to race. I doesn’t mean that we’re in a post racial society. It doesn’t mean that racism is eliminated," he said. "But you know, when I talk to Malia and Sasha and I listen to their friends and I see them interact, they’re better than we are."\nObama added: "We have to be vigilant and we have to work on these issues, and those of us in authority should be doing everything we can to encourage the better angels of our nature as opposed to using these episodes to heighten divisions. But we should also have confidence that kids these days I think have more sense than we did back then, and certainly more than our parents did or our grandparents did, and that along this long, difficult journey, we’re becoming a more perfect union -- not a perfect union, but a more perfect union."\nThis story was originally published on Fri Jul 19, 2013 1:46 PM EDT\nPopular Discussions

Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency leaker, has given a wide-ranging interview to The Washington Post about the effects of the startling information he shared this year with journalists, shedding light on the U.S. surveillance apparatus.\nThe revelations from Snowden, a former NSA contractor, about the American government\'s surveillance of its citizens and allies have generated fierce debate over intelligence-gathering practices.\nHere are five key takeaways from the interview, the first Snowden has given in person since he arrived in Russia in June.\n1. His mission is \'already accomplished\'\n"For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission\'s already accomplished. I already won," Snowden told The Washington Post\'s Barton Gellman in Moscow. "As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because, remember, I didn\'t want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself."\nSnowden left his job in Hawaii with the NSA contract firm Booz Allen Hamilton and fled to Hong Kong in May, taking with him a hoard of secret information about intelligence programs. He shared the files with Gellman and journalists from The Guardian, a British newspaper.\nThe ensuing articles about how the NSA hoovers up vast amounts of phone and Internet data about American citizens sparked an uproar, with Snowden described as a hero by some and a traitor by others. Many more articles about other controversial aspects of U.S. surveillance have followed, and Snowden has said there\'s plenty more information still to be revealed.\nA review of NSA surveillance practices ordered by the White House has recommended changes to the program, including greater judicial oversight and more public transparency in the collection of data. Key American allies, like Germany and Brazil, have publicly condemned U.S. surveillance of their leaders.\n"All I wanted was for the public to be able to have a say in how they are governed," Snowden said. "That is a milestone we left a long time ago. Right now, all we are looking at are stretch goals."\nGellman told CNN that his impression was not that Snowden was gloating, but that his goal to strip some of the secrecy off the NSA\'s activities had been achieved.\nSnowden has so far managed to dodge the U.S. government\'s attempts to bring him back to America to face charges of espionage and theft of government property. And he\'s not taking any chances as he lives in asylum in Russia.\nGellman reported that during more than 14 hours of conversations in Moscow, Snowden didn\'t once "part the curtains or step outside."\nSnowden, 30, described his life as that of an "indoor cat." He said he doesn\'t drink alcohol and lives on ramen noodles and chips.\n"It has always been really difficult to get me to leave the house," he told Gellman. "I just don\'t have a lot of needs. ... Occasionally there\'s things to go do, things to go see, people to meet, tasks to accomplish. But it\'s really got to be goal-oriented, you know. Otherwise, as long as I can sit down and think and write and talk to somebody, that\'s more meaningful to me than going out and looking at landmarks."\nHe said Snowden does not want to continuing being part of the story, but wants to see his cause advance.\nSnowden has had continuous access to the Internet and talks to journalists and his lawyers on a daily basis, the Post reported.\nPeople who visit him bring him books, but he doesn\'t read them, preferring to get his information from the Internet.\nGellman reported that it was unclear to what degree Snowden was under surveillance by Russian authorities, saying that "no retinue" accompanied Snowden and that he didn\'t see anybody else nearby.\nSnowden said some other people who worked for the NSA\'s surveillance system also had misgivings about the activities.\nHe told Gellman that he raised concerns with colleagues and with superiors in the NSA\'s Technology Directorate and the NSA Threat Operations Center\'s regional base in Hawaii.\nHis co-workers were often "astonished to learn we are collecting more in the United States on Americans than we are on Russians in Russia," Snowden told the Post.\nA lot of his colleagues were disturbed by what they heard, Snowden said, and several asked him not to tell them any more.\n"I asked these people, \'What do you think the public would do if this was on the front page?\' " he said, according to the Post.\n"How is that not reporting it? How is that not raising it?" he said in response to criticism that he circumvented the NSA\'s internal channels for disagreement.\nThe NSA said in a statement to the Post that it had "not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden\'s contention that he brought these matters to anyone\'s attention."\nAsked why he felt entitled to bring the NSA\'s intrusive activities to public attention, Snowden told the Post: "That whole question -- who elected you? -- inverts the model. They elected me. The overseers."\n"It wasn\'t that they put it on me as an individual -- that I\'m uniquely qualified, an angel descending from the heavens -- as that they put it on someone, somewhere," he said. "You have the capability, and you realize every other (person) sitting around the table has the same capability but they don\'t do it. So somebody has to be the first."\nEver since he stepped into the public eye, Snowden has insisted that he should not be at the center of the story. The real issue, he says, is the NSA\'s far-reaching surveillance programs.\nHe maintained that stance with Gellman, saying that he\'s shrugged off personal attacks against him with the intent of keeping the focus on the NSA.\nHe dismissed suggestions that he\'s made any deals with the governments of the countries where he\'s taken refuge from U.S. authorities.\n"There is no evidence at all for the claim that I have loyalties to Russia or China or any country other than the United States," Snowden told Gellman. "I have no relationship with the Russian government. I have not entered into any agreements with them."

The Illinois Senate left the State Capitol later today without voting on measures to legalize gay marriage and outlaw assault weapons, leaving the fate of those controversial issues in doubt.\nA committee advanced the same-sex marriage bill late this afternoon, but the sponsor acknowledged she did not have enough votes to win approval on the Senate floor.\nSen. Heather Steans, D-Chicago, dismissed a question on whether she ever had a solid 30 votes lined up to pass the legislation. "Oh, no, no, no," Steans said. "We really did have the votes. We were just missing members today."\nSuch are the political dynamics of a lame-duck session in Springfield: some lawmakers who are in their final days of service don\'t show up to work, making it difficult to pass tough legislation.\nThe Senate\'s failure to take a final vote also came after a furious lobbying pushback by the Catholic Conference of Illinois and Cardinal Francis George.\nThe Senate Executive Committee advanced the measure on an 8-5 vote following a lengthy debate that featured testimony from both sides of the issue.\n"It\'s not often that we really have a chance in this chamber to be taking a look at something providing a basic civil right and advancing fairness," said sponsoring Sen. Steans. "Same-sex couples want to marry for the same reasons we all do--for commitment, family, mutual responsibility.\nSteans said gay couples have suffered from the 2nd-class status. Underscoring Steans\' point was emotional testimony from Mercedes Santos and Theresa Volpe, a lesbian couple from Rogers Park who got a civil union in Illinois.\n"Right now, we are in a civil union, but it is not enough," testified Theresa Volpe.\nSpringfield Catholic Bishop Thomas John Paprocki testified against the proposal, saying, "It would radically redefine what marriage is for everybody." He maintained the "natural family" is undermined by the legislation.\n"Neither two men nor two women can possibly form a marriage," Paprocki said. "Our law would be wrong if it said that they could.\n"The basic structure of marriage as the exclusive and lasting relationship of a man and a woman, committed to a life with the potential of having children, is given to us in human nature, and thus by nature\'s God," Paprocki said.\nAt the same time, an effort to ban semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines --- backed by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel --- also lacked the votes needed for passage. Opponents argued the measure was too broad and unworkable.\nWith no action on those two controversial issues, senators were preparing to return home. A final day of the Senate\'s lame-duck session remains an option for Tuesday, the day before the next General Assembly is inaugurated. But that could depend on whether the House takes any action. House members are scheduled to be in Springfield from Sunday through Tuesday.\nrlong@tribune.com\nrap30@aol.com\nTwitter @RayLong

Well this is awkward.\nIf you missed Barack Obama's impromptu speech last Friday on the realities of growing up black in the same country as Trayvon Martin, this is the passage that's most essential for understanding why New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly would make a baffling choice to become the country's top domestic security official:\nYou know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African-American community at least, there’s a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it’s important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that -- that doesn’t go away.\nThere are very few African-American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me.\nAnd there are very few African-American men who haven’t had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me, at least before I was a senator. There are very few African-Americans who haven’t had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often.\nMORE FROM THE ATLANTIC CITIES\nStop-and-frisk, the deeply controversial policing tactic that Kelly has led and defended in New York City, is essentially the institutional version of everything that Obama describes above. The only difference is that the people following blacks in New York, eying them with distrust and suspecting them of being up to no good, are police officers. And they have the power to pat people down and detain them, one indignity piled onto another.

Very good article. I think Mr. McNamara does a good job exposing the complexities of these problems. I certainly would not want to be stopped and frisked, hence would not wish it on others.

Civil rights groups in the US have expressed dismay after neighbourhood watchman George Zimmerman was found not guilty of murdering black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida last year.\nThe case sparked a fierce debate in the US about racial profiling.\nMr Zimmerman\'s family and lawyers have said they now fear he could face revenge attacks.\nPresident Barack Obama called for calm, saying the death was a tragedy for America, but that "a jury has spoken".\n"I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher," Mr Obama said in a statement.\nHe asked Americans to respect the Martin family\'s call for calm reflection and to ask "if we\'re doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities".\n"We should ask ourselves if we\'re doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis.\n"We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that\'s a job for all of us. That\'s the way to honour Trayvon Martin."\nDefence \'ecstatic\'\nProsecutors had argued that Mr Zimmerman, 29, opened fired on 26 February 2012 because he racially profiled Trayvon Martin as he walked through his neighbourhood wearing a hooded sweatshirt in the rain, and assumed he was up to no good.\nTrayvon Martin was African-American. Mr Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic.\nBut the defence said he shot Trayvon Martin in self defence after the teenager had punched their client, slammed his head into the pavement and reached for Mr Zimmerman\'s gun.\nMr Zimmerman was facing possible conviction for second-degree murder or manslaughter. On Saturday he was cleared of all charges by the six-woman jury at Seminole County Criminal Justice Center in Sanford, Florida.\nDefence lawyer Mark O\'Mara said he was "ecstatic", and that Mr Zimmerman "was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self defence".\n"I\'m glad that the jury saw it that way," he said.\nAnother defence lawyer, Don West, said the prosecution of his client had been "disgraceful".\n"As happy as I am for George Zimmerman, I\'m thrilled that this jury kept this tragedy from becoming a travesty," he said.\nHowever, following the verdict, protest marches were staged in US cities including San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington and Atlanta.\nIn Oakland, California, some protesters started small fires and smashed windows.\nCivil rights leader Jesse Jackson told CNN on Sunday: "I remain stunned at the decision. The Department of Justice must intervene to take this to another level."\nIt appears to be very difficult for black Americans to seek justice in the legal systemRandal Lea\nZimmerman acquittal: Your views\nIn a Facebook posting, he said "the American legal system has once again failed justice". But he also appealed for calm, saying anyone seeking to "compound our pain with street justice" would do "damage to the innocent blood and legacy of Trayvon Martin".\nRights activist Al Sharpton also appealed for calm, but said the verdict was "a slap in the face to the American people".\nHe compared the case to the beating of African-American man Rodney King by police in 1991, which sparked widespread rioting.\nA petition launched by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), demanding that the DoJ open a civil rights case against Mr Zimmerman, had received more than 350,000 signatures by midday on Sunday.\nThe petition says that "the most fundamental of civil rights - the right to life - was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin".\nRevenge fears\nDaryl Parks, lawyer for the Martin family, told BBC News he hoped the case would be a wake-up call for the US.\n"Many will realise that if there is a law that would allow you to kill an unarmed teenager, then that\'s a law that we probably should look at and change," he said.\nFlorida police had angered many by not arresting Mr Zimmerman for six weeks after the shooting, citing the state\'s controversial "stand your ground" law, which allows a citizen to use lethal force if he or she feels in imminent danger.\nBut Mr Parks said the trial had given the US "a new perspective on black life - when a young black person gets killed, the approach that it takes to investigate, to arrest the person that did it".\nMeanwhile Mr Zimmerman\'s family and representatives have said they are afraid he could fall victim to revenge attacks.\nHis brother, Robert said he had received frequent threats on social media and there was "more reason now than ever to think that people are trying to kill him".\n"He\'s going to be looking over his shoulder the rest of his life," he said.

The Illinois Senate left the State Capitol later today without voting on measures to legalize gay marriage and outlaw assault weapons, leaving the fate of those controversial issues in doubt.\nA committee advanced the same-sex marriage bill late this afternoon, but the sponsor acknowledged she did not have enough votes to win approval on the Senate floor.\nSen. Heather Steans, D-Chicago, dismissed a question on whether she ever had a solid 30 votes lined up to pass the legislation. "Oh, no, no, no," Steans said. "We really did have the votes. We were just missing members today."\nSuch are the political dynamics of a lame-duck session in Springfield: some lawmakers who are in their final days of service don\'t show up to work, making it difficult to pass tough legislation.\nThe Senate’s failure to take a final vote also came after a furious lobbying pushback by the Catholic Conference of Illinois and Cardinal Francis George.\nThe Senate Executive Committee advanced the measure on an 8-5 vote following a lengthy debate that featured testimony from both sides of the issue.\n"It\'s not often that we really have a chance in this chamber to be taking a look at something providing a basic civil right and advancing fairness," said sponsoring Sen. Steans. "Same-sex couples want to marry for the same reasons we all do--for commitment, family, mutual responsibility.\nSteans said gay couples have suffered from the 2nd-class status. Underscoring Steans\' point was emotional testimony from Mercedes Santos and Theresa Volpe, a lesbian couple from Rogers Park who got a civil union in Illinois.\n"Right now, we are in a civil union, but it is not enough," testified Theresa Volpe.\nSpringfield Catholic Bishop Thomas John Paprocki testified against the proposal, saying, "It would radically redefine what marriage is for everybody." He maintained the "natural family" is undermined by the legislation.\n"Neither two men nor two women can possibly form a marriage," Paprocki said. "Our law would be wrong if it said that they could.\n"The basic structure of marriage as the exclusive and lasting relationship of a man and a woman, committed to a life with the potential of having children, is given to us in human nature, and thus by nature\'s God," Paprocki said.\nAt the same time, an effort to ban semi-automatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines --- backed by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel --- also lacked the votes needed for passage. Opponents argued the measure was too broad and unworkable.\nWith no action on those two controversial issues, senators were preparing to return home. A final day of the Senate’s lame-duck session remains an option for Tuesday, the day before the next General Assembly is inaugurated. But that could depend on whether the House takes any action. House members are scheduled to be in Springfield from Sunday through Tuesday.\nrlong@tribune.com\nrap30@aol.com\nTwitter @RayLong

USA TODAY\nThe Rand Paul vs. Chris Christie spat appears to be getting nastier.\nPaul, a Kentucky senator, escalated his attacks on the New Jersey governor, saying on Fox News that it is "kind of sad and cheap" that his fellow Republican is using "the cloak of 9/11 victims" to criticize him on national security.\nChristie followed up Tuesday with a shot about Kentucky\'s federal spending, along with his trademark straight talk. "Get in line" if you\'ve got a personal problem with his bluntness, the governor said.\nWhile Christie and Paul are both mentioned as potential Republican presidential candidates in 2016, their verbal fusillades aren\'t a sideshow. Their dispute about national security and federal spending exposes the fissures within the GOP -- similar to another battle being waged now over immigration -- that will likely be played out in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina during the presidential primaries.\nThis all began last week when Christie said at an Aspen Institute forum that there is a "strain of libertarianism" within the Republican Party by those who oppose the National Security Agency\'s warrantless surveillance program and other counterterrorism techniques. The governor said Paul and others in the GOP could come to New Jersey and explain their opposition to the "widows and orphans" who lost loved ones in the Sept. 11 terror attacks.\nPaul\'s first response Sunday was to go after Christie on federal spending, and what he called a "gimme, gimme, gimme" attitude when it came to Superstorm Sandy aid.\nDuring a Fox News appearance Monday, the Kentucky senator teed off again. First, Paul said the Republican Party in the Northeast is "on life support" and that "it\'s not real smart for Republicans to be attacking Republicans." Then Paul threw 9/11 back at Christie before repeating the federal spending charge.\nChristie said Tuesday that he\'s got "nothing personal" against the senator, but said Paul\'s words seem as though "he has something personal against me, but that\'s OK. He can just get in line on that front."\nAs for the charges on federal spending, Christie noted that New Jersey gets back 61 cents for every dollar sent to Washington while Kentucky receives $1.51. "Maybe he should start cutting the pork-barrel spending that he brings home to Kentucky," the governor said.\nSounds like the ball is back in Paul\'s court. Over to you, senator.

And what do you know, Chris Dorner, the former police officer suspected of being behind the murder rampage presently unfolding in Los Angeles, has apparently addressed to America that the media are already selectively reporting on to leave out the more inconvenient portions. You see, there is no political upside for the media to reveal the politics of suspected madman.

More\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department and a congressional committee disagree on the pace of their talks to settle a lawsuit over congressional efforts to get records related to Operation Fast and Furious, a bungled gun-tracking operation.\nIn a joint filing Friday night, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee told the judge in the case that a settlement offer it received from the Justice Department this week was a "grave disappointment" and that a settlement is not possible.\n"The parties are very, very far apart," lawyers for the GOP-led committee wrote. "Indeed, they are not even conceptually on the same page. After nearly four months of negotiating in good faith, the committee reluctantly has concluded — principally as a result of the department\'s settlement document — that the attorney general is not serious about settlement." The committee added that it didn\'t think court-ordered mediation would help.\nPresident Barack Obama has invoked executive privilege and Attorney General Eric Holder has been found in contempt of the House for refusing to turn over records that might explain what led the Justice Department to reverse course, after initially denying to Congress that federal agents had used a controversial tactic called gun-walking in the failed law enforcement operation.\nThe department has already turned over 7,600 pages of documents on the operation itself. The continuing dispute is over documents describing how the department responded to the congressional investigation of the operation.\nIn the same filing Friday, the Justice Department said it disagreed with the committee\'s characterization of the settlement negotiations and that a settlement is still possible.\nWithout getting into specifics, the department said it "provided a meaningful offer to the committee to produce documents directly responsive to the committee\'s identified outstanding interests." The department added that mediation by a judge would be helpful.
